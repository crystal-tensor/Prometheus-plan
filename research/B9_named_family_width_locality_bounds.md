## Analytic Bound Statement

- For the open-boundary cluster stabilizer family, every generated term has support size 2 or 3.
- The B9 local_interaction_reweight_v0 transformation multiplies every support>=2 term by 1.35.
- Therefore H'_n = 1.35 * H_n for the generated family rows.
- Positive uniform scaling preserves eigenvectors and scales both spectral gap and spectral width by 1.35.
- The normalized gap gap(H)/width(H) is invariant, while max locality remains 3.

## Finite Row Checks

- n=4: term_count=4, supports=[2, 3], unique_scales=[1.35], max_support=3
- n=5: term_count=5, supports=[2, 3], unique_scales=[1.35], max_support=3
- n=6: term_count=6, supports=[2, 3], unique_scales=[1.35], max_support=3

## Rejection Reason

Raw spectral gap growth is exactly global positive energy rescaling; spectral width scales by the same factor, so normalized gap does not improve.

## Claim Boundary

- Supported: a named-family analytic skeleton explaining why the B9 v0 cluster-stabilizer local reweight rows are only uniform energy rescaling.
- Supported: finite rows n=4,5,6 match the symbolic locality/width story.
- Not supported: proof-assistant checked theorem, Quantum PCP proof, NLTS theorem, or global gap-amplification no-go theorem.

## Remaining Steps

- Formalize the parameterized open-boundary cluster stabilizer Hamiltonian in an actual Lean/mathlib project.
- Prove the support-size and uniform-scaling lemmas over all n >= 4.
- Prove spectral gap, spectral width, and normalized-gap scaling for positive scalar multiplication of self-adjoint matrices.
- Connect the finite JSON rows to generated certificates rather than manual inspection.
- Generalize from this rejected uniform-scaling family to nontrivial locality-preserving transformations or prove a narrower no-go theorem.

# B1-B10 Solution Sprint 001

Last updated: 2026-06-17

Purpose: start the active technical push from B1 to B10. This sprint does not
claim that any of the ten problems is solved. It turns each direction into a
testable work package with a concrete hypothesis, algorithmic move, evidence
standard, and PR-ready task. Publication, patent, financing, and product work
remain downstream until the relevant technical gate is passed.

## Sprint Thesis

The fastest credible path is not ten isolated moonshots. It is four coupled
spines:

| Spine | Tracks | Sprint result we want |
|---|---|---|
| Systems spine | B1, B2, B7 | A compiler/QEC/FT ledger where local savings survive factories and schedules. |
| Verification spine | B4, B8, B10 | A circuit-level hidden task whose verification cost and leakage assumptions are explicit. |
| Application spine | B3, B5, B6, B10 | Observable-first chemistry/materials benchmarks with strong classical denominators. |
| Theory spine | B9, B10 | Negative lemmas and boundary notes that prevent overclaiming. |

## Sprint Rules

1. A work package must be falsifiable in one PR.
2. Every positive claim needs a named baseline and a limitation section.
3. Every result that changes project status needs machine-readable output,
   a human-readable report, and an audit hook.
4. The translation pipeline is unlocked only after a technical gate passes.
5. Failed approaches are kept if they produce a clean negative result.

## B1: Hardware-Aware Circuit Compression

**Technical target:** reduce routed two-qubit work, exposure, and
fault-tolerant T-resource proxies while preserving replayable semantic
certificates.

**Sprint hypothesis:** the current virtual-SWAP and 1Q resynthesis evidence can
be strengthened by adding a native-basis non-Clifford/T-depth pass that reduces
minimum B7 factory-dominated STV, not only mean STV.

**Algorithmic move:** build a proof-logged phase-gadget and Rz-commutation pass
that detects same-wire and post-virtual-SWAP non-Clifford rotation chains,
canonicalizes them under native-basis cost, and emits local certificate events.

**Next PR:** `T-B1-001`. Expected artifacts:

- `tools/b1_native_t_resource_optimizer.py`
- `results/B1_native_t_resource_optimizer_v0.json`
- `research/B1_native_t_resource_optimizer.md`
- optional update to B7 retest inputs

**Acceptance gate:** 30-circuit suite passes measurement-distribution or exact
checks; T-count or T-depth proxy improves on at least one factory-bottlenecked
workload; B7 retest reports whether min STV moves above 1.0x.

**Failure value:** if min STV remains 1.0x, record the bottleneck class and
split B7 claims into data-path and T-factory regimes.

**Sprint 001 update, 2026-06-15:** first native pass is now implemented as
`tools/b1_native_t_resource_optimizer.py`. It canonicalizes
`u3(0, phi, lambda)` into native Z-phase form, emits 1691 proof events across
30 circuits, changes 26 circuits, removes 4 identity 1Q gates, and passes a
30/30 Aer measurement-distribution cross-check with max TVD 0.0. It reduces the
incremental logical T-count proxy by 1.000990x after post-1Q resynthesis. B7
propagation improves mean STV from 1.034436848x to 1.034608523x, but minimum
STV remains 1.0x. This completes `T-B1-001` as a narrow positive diagnostic and
creates `T-B1-002`: target the factory-boundary workloads
`qasmbench_medium_exact/gcm_h6.qasm`, `qasmbench_medium_exact/sat_n11.qasm`,
and `qasmbench_small/hhl_n7.qasm`, where T-count reduction is still 1.0x.

**Sprint 001 update 2, 2026-06-15:** `T-B1-002` now has a positive diagnostic:
`tools/b1_control_rz_commute_optimizer.py` accumulates RZ gates and commutes
them only across CNOTs where the same qubit is the control. It removes 380 RZ
gates, records 1172 CNOT-control commutations, emits 1307 certificate events,
and passes 30/30 Aer measurement-distribution checks with max TVD 0.0. B1
logical T-count proxy improves by 1.119320x over the native pass. B7 propagation
breaks the previous min-STV boundary: min STV is now 1.121951x and mean STV is
1.183921x under the current proxy schedule. This is a serious B1/B7 systems
spine advance, but it remains a diagnostic because arbitrary U3 rotations and
full fault-tolerant synthesis/layout are still outside the pass. New `T-B1-003`
should target remaining arbitrary-rotation factory cost with a general
phase-polynomial or native-U3 synthesis ledger.

**Sprint 001 update 3, 2026-06-15:** `T-B1-003` is now implemented as
`tools/b1_u3_phase_factored_optimizer.py`. The pass factors remaining
`u3(theta, phi, lambda)` gates into the native QASM execution order
`rz(lambda); ry(theta); rz(phi)` up to global phase, then reuses the
control-RZ commute/merge rule. It factors 1641 U3 gates, emits 1641
factorization certificate events plus 3242 RZ-commute certificate events,
removes 313 additional RZ gates, records 540 CNOT-control commutations after
factoring, and passes 30/30 Aer measurement-distribution checks with max TVD
0.0. Incremental B1 logical T-count proxy improves by 1.036371x over the
control-RZ pass, and B7 propagation improves mean STV from 1.183921x to
1.234394x. Minimum STV remains 1.121951x, so the boundary has not moved again;
the next B1/B7 work should either attack the remaining `sat_n11` minimum-STV
regime or replace the proxy with a real FT synthesis/layout/factory ledger.

## B2: Low-Overhead Quantum Error Correction

**Technical target:** beat a surface-code baseline on Wilson-bounded target
volume under identical assumptions.

**Sprint hypothesis:** the previous Clifford/CX hardening signal is real, but
it must be converted from a target-hit improvement into a volume improvement by
using the same hardware footprint and a better schedule/noise mechanism.

**Algorithmic move:** create a schedule family that couples Clifford/CX
hardening with biased correlated noise fields, then selects rows by Wilson 95%
high logical-error bounds and total space-time volume.

**Next PR:** `T-B2-001`. Expected artifacts:

- `tools/b2_same_hardware_schedule_candidate.py`
- `results/B2_same_hardware_schedule_candidate_v0.json`
- `research/B2_same_hardware_schedule_candidate.md`

**Acceptance gate:** at least one Wilson-bounded target-volume reduction
against the surface-code baseline at the same distance, basis, shot budget, and
decoder.

**Failure value:** if target hits improve but volume does not, preserve the
result as evidence that schedule hardening helps reliability but not overhead.

**Sprint update 15:** `T-B2-001` is now implemented as
`tools/b2_same_hardware_schedule_candidate.py`. The tool keeps the same
rotated-surface-code family, distance grid, memory bases, physical-error grid,
shot budget, physical qubits per distance, and PyMatching decoder, then uses
reduced syndrome rounds as the schedule-level volume lever. The official run
tested 120 configurations and 360,000 shots. Against the same Wilson 95%
target-volume table, candidate-met targets increased from 22 to 30, candidate-
only target hits increased to 8, and 22 target rows showed lower space-time
volume. The max and mean reduction on improved rows are both 3.0x because the
best rows use the aggressive `d-4` round-reduced all-operations-hardened
schedule at distance 3. This is the first B2 Wilson target-volume positive
diagnostic, but it is not a new code, threshold, or calibrated-device claim.

**Sprint update 16:** `T-B2-001` now has a robustness boundary report:
`tools/b2_same_hardware_schedule_robustness.py` stress-tests the positive
schedule over four profiles: higher-shot reseed, mild 0.60 noise mismatch,
moderate 0.75 noise mismatch, and Clifford-only physical mechanism. The formal
run used 240 configurations and 1,200,000 shots. It preserves 88 Wilson target-
volume improved rows under stress, but all 88 come from the aggressive `d-4`
variant and 0 come from non-aggressive `d-2` variants. Therefore B2 has a real
schedule-level diagnostic, not a strengthened low-overhead QEC claim.

**Next PR:** `T-B2-002`. Find a non-aggressive or physically motivated
reduced-round schedule/code mechanism that survives larger-distance and
noise-mismatch Wilson target-volume stress, or convert the reduced-round signal
into a small-distance artifact/boundary note before allowing B2 to feed a
stronger B7 ledger.

**Sprint update 31:** `T-B2-002` is now merged as a reduced-round artifact
boundary note, not as a low-overhead QEC win. The new tool
`tools/b2_reduced_round_artifact_boundary.py` consumes
`results/B2_same_hardware_schedule_candidate_v0.json` and
`results/B2_same_hardware_schedule_robustness_v0.json`, then emits
`results/B2_reduced_round_artifact_boundary_v0.json` and
`research/B2_reduced_round_artifact_boundary.md`. It confirms that the 22
original volume-positive rows and the 88 stress-preserved rows are all
aggressive, distance-3, one-round candidates; robust non-aggressive improved
rows remain 0. The reduced-round lever is therefore closed as a
small-distance/aggressive-schedule artifact boundary until a genuinely
different mechanism appears. Next: `T-B2-003` should start a new B2 mechanism:
non-aggressive schedule, different code family, leakage-aware circuit model,
or larger-distance decoder improvement with distance-5/7 Wilson target-volume
reductions under noise mismatch.

**Sprint update 39:** `T-B2-003` is now merged as a leakage-flagged erasure
analytic boundary. `tools/b2_leakage_flagged_erasure_boundary.py` emits
`results/B2_leakage_flagged_erasure_boundary_v0.json` and
`research/B2_leakage_flagged_erasure_boundary.md`. It runs 480 analytic
configurations and finds 42 proxy target-volume improved rows, including 33
candidate distance-5/7 rows, with no reduced rounds and no distance-3
candidates. This is a new non-aggressive direction, but it remains a formula
proxy, not a circuit-level decoder, threshold, calibrated-device, or new-code
claim.

**Sprint update 40:** `T-B2-004` is now merged as a Stim heralded-erasure
stress boundary. `tools/b2_stim_heralded_erasure_stress.py` injects
`DEPOLARIZE1` or `HERALDED_ERASE` after each `TICK` of generated rotated
surface-code memory circuits, then decodes with PyMatching from the detector
error model. The default run covers 108 configurations and 216,000 shots, with
72 target comparisons, 59 candidate-met rows vs 53 baseline-met rows, 7
candidate-only target hits, and 10 improved target-volume rows. All 10 improved
rows are candidate distance 5 or 7; max reduction is 4.598x and mean reduction
is 2.623x after flag overhead. This is stronger than the analytic proxy, but it
is still not a shot-conditioned erasure decoder, calibrated leakage model,
threshold, hardware, or new-code claim. Next: `T-B2-005` should replace this
detector-error-model stress with a shot-conditioned erasure decoder or
calibrated leakage model.

## B3: Molecular Reaction Dynamics

**Technical target:** produce a reaction-coordinate quantum observable estimate
that is compared against strong classical chemistry denominators.

**Sprint hypothesis:** the B10 FCI-strength reference rows can become the first
observable-level denominator for a quantum circuit comparison if B3 emits
Hamiltonians along one toy reaction coordinate.

**Algorithmic move:** generate a multi-point PySCF reaction path, map each
Hamiltonian to qubit operators, and compare Trotter/LCU/qubitization-style
observable estimation resources against RHF/MP2/CCSD/FCI denominator rows.

**Next PR:** `T-B3-001`. Expected artifacts:

- `tools/b3_reaction_path_observable_circuit.py`
- `results/B3_reaction_path_observable_circuit_v0.json`
- `research/B3_reaction_path_observable_circuit.md`

**Acceptance gate:** one reaction-coordinate observable has Hamiltonian rows,
classical denominator values, circuit/resource estimates, and propagated
observable error.

**Failure value:** if the quantum resource estimate loses to denominators, the
negative result feeds B10 boundary notes.

## B4: Verifiable Quantum Advantage

**Technical target:** instantiate a circuit-level task that is checkable by the
verifier but hard to spoof cheaply.

**Sprint hypothesis:** B4 should merge its toy trap model with B8's
refresh/rotation repair so the verifier can test adaptive spoofers on circuit
outputs rather than abstract samples.

**Algorithmic move:** generate hidden-trap circuits with embedded invariant
checks, then rotate challenges between batches and measure completeness and
soundness under adaptive spoofers.

**Next PR:** `T-B4-001`. Expected artifacts:

- `tools/b4_b8_hidden_task_generator.py`
- `results/B4_B8_hidden_task_refresh_v0.json`
- `research/B4_B8_hidden_task_refresh.md`

**Acceptance gate:** honest completeness stays high while adaptive spoofer
soundness remains below the configured threshold under at least two refresh
modes.

**Failure value:** if spoofers win, the leakage pattern becomes a B10 verifier
burden condition.

**Sprint update 18:** `T-B4-001` is now merged with `T-B8-001` as a shared
B4/B8 circuit-level proxy task. The new tool
`tools/b4_b8_circuit_refresh_task.py` builds random CNOT hidden-projection
sampling tasks, derives verifier masks from explicit circuits, and attacks the
tasks with four adaptive spoofer families across leakage fractions and refresh
modes. The official run emits `results/B4_B8_circuit_refresh_task_v0.json` and
`research/B4_B8_circuit_refresh_task.md`: 3 tasks, 192 configurations, minimum
honest completeness 1.0, no-refresh high-leakage max soundness 0.675, and best
repaired high-leakage max soundness 0.0. This is not a quantum advantage claim;
it is the first circuit-level B4/B8 verification proxy with a clear leakage
failure and refresh/rotation repair boundary.

## B5: Strongly Correlated Matter

**Technical target:** show an accuracy-per-resource improvement on a meaningful
strongly correlated observable.

**Sprint hypothesis:** the exact Hubbard denominator can be made more serious
by adding a boundary-field or tensor-network embedding baseline before testing
any quantum response subroutine.

**Algorithmic move:** add a boundary-field embedding baseline for 2D or doped
Hubbard patches and compare recovered cluster-product error fraction against
the current exact small-system denominator.

**Next PR:** `T-B5-001`. Expected artifacts:

- `tools/b5_boundary_embedding_baseline.py`
- `results/B5_boundary_embedding_baseline_v0.json`
- `research/B5_boundary_embedding_baseline.md`

**Acceptance gate:** report exact denominator, embedding baseline, error per
site, observable choice, and where a quantum impurity/kernel would enter.

**Failure value:** if the classical embedding baseline is already strong, use
it as a denominator for B10 rather than overclaiming quantum advantage.

**Sprint update 19:** `T-B5-004` is now merged as a two-site
finite-DMRG-style pressure prototype on the same 9 B5/B10 D5 Hubbard
density-response rows. The official run tests bond dimension 4 with 2 restarts
x 4 sweeps, selected mean/max relative response error 0.08196/0.27710, selected
mean/max energy error per site 0.01619/0.02836, min exact-state overlap
0.93945, 4 rows beating the one-site MPS/ALS prototype, and 0 rows beating the
exact-state-seeded MPS pressure reference. This is not canonical-environment
production DMRG, not a deployable tensor solver, and not a quantum advantage
claim; it is a denominator-pressure artifact for the next B10-T1 gate.

## B6: High-Temperature Superconductivity Search

**Technical target:** rank candidate materials using mechanism-aware
descriptors while controlling family-prior leakage.

**Sprint hypothesis:** the curated table and formula-derived proxy screen are
useful only as leakage controls; the next useful artifact must use
crystallographic, DFT, or B5-computed observables.

**Algorithmic move:** replace formula-derived proxies with computed
structural/electronic descriptors, keep family/time leakage controls, and
charge any B5 observable coupling as a separate evidence channel.

**Current evidence:** `T-B6-002` adds 38 records / 22 families with 12 expanded
negative controls, formula-derived descriptors, B5-linked correlation/screening
proxies, formula AP@12 0.10, family-prior AP@12 1.0, post-split formula AP
0.5947, and no discovery/mechanism/database/computed-observable claim.

**Next PR:** `T-B6-003`. Expected artifacts:

- `benchmarks/B6_high_temperature_superconductivity.yaml`
- `tools/b6_computed_descriptor_audit.py`
- `results/B6_computed_descriptor_audit_v0.json`
- `research/B6_computed_descriptor_audit.md`

**Acceptance gate:** computed descriptors are reported separately from
family-prior and formula-proxy baselines under random, time-forward, and
family-held-out splits; B5-derived observables must disclose whether they are
real computed observables or only proxies.

**Failure value:** if performance collapses under family-held-out evaluation,
the project avoids false discovery claims and moves toward data-quality work.

## B7: Fault-Tolerance Co-Design

**Technical target:** create an end-to-end resource ledger where compiler and
QEC improvements survive workload DAGs, factories, layout, and feed-forward.

**Sprint hypothesis:** B7 should use B1 as the active lever, but only count
savings that survive factory bottlenecks and minimum-STV tests.

**Algorithmic move:** retest B7 with the new B1 native T-resource pass and
separate data-path-dominated, factory-dominated, and feed-forward-dominated
workloads.

**Next PR:** `T-B7-001`. Expected artifacts:

- `tools/b7_min_stv_regime_classifier.py`
- `results/B7_min_stv_regime_classifier_v0.json`
- `research/B7_min_stv_regime_classifier.md`

**Acceptance gate:** every workload row reports dominant bottleneck, pre/post
STV, min/mean reductions, and whether the improvement is data-path or
T-factory driven.

**Failure value:** if B1 cannot move factory-dominated min STV, B7 becomes a
claim-separation paper rather than a universal reduction claim.

**Sprint update 4:** `T-B7-001` is now merged. The classifier consumes
`logical_t_factory_schedule_u3_phase_factored_v0` and identifies the remaining
minimum-STV row as `qasmbench_medium_exact/sat_n11.qasm` under
`throughput_heavy_factories`: STV reduction 1.121951x, logical T reduction
1.122137x, after-T proxy 5240, and 18/18 schedule rows still factory-path
bottlenecked. U3 phase factoring improves portfolio mean STV, but not this
minimum row.

**Next PR:** `T-B1-004` should remove another 344 logical T proxy from
`sat_n11` to reach 1.20x min STV, or produce a negative boundary for the current
local phase-pass family. `T-B7-002` should replace the fixed rotation T-cost
proxy with an FT synthesis ledger; the 1.25x min-STV target currently requires
544 additional T proxy removal if the same factory footprint is held fixed.

**Sprint update 5:** `T-B7-002` is now merged. The new FT synthesis ledger
classifies exact rotations instead of charging every non-Clifford rotation a
fixed 20-T proxy. Under this ledger, `sat_n11` is re-costed from 294 to 262 T
ledger units and reaches 1.611481x STV reduction under balanced and
throughput-heavy factory variants, moving those rows from factory-path to
data-path bottlenecks. The new minimum row is
`qasmbench_medium_exact/gcm_h6.qasm` under `throughput_heavy_factories` at
1.086008x STV reduction, with portfolio mean STV at 1.253640x.

**Next PR:** `T-B7-003` should attack the new `gcm_h6` FT-ledger boundary or
show that its remaining arbitrary numeric rotations require a stronger
synthesis, routing, or layout assumption before B7 can claim a robust min-STV
win.

**Sprint update 6:** `T-B7-003` is now merged as a quantified boundary result.
The current FT-ledger minimum row is `qasmbench_medium_exact/gcm_h6.qasm` under
`throughput_heavy_factories`, with STV reduction 1.086008x and 270 after-side
arbitrary numeric rotations contributing 5400 / 6224 T ledger units. To push
that current row to 1.20x requires 592 additional T-ledger reduction, equivalent
to about 30 arbitrary rotations at cost 20; 1.25x requires 824 T-ledger
reduction, about 42 such rotations. A portfolio-wide arbitrary-rotation cost
sweep from 20 down to 0 does **not** clear the all-variant 1.20x min-STV
threshold, because other factory/layout variants become the bottleneck.

**Next PR:** `T-B7-004` should add a precision-aware arbitrary-rotation
synthesis/layout ledger for `gcm_h6`, or turn this into a formal negative
boundary for local phase passes under the current factory variants.

**Sprint update 7:** `T-B7-004` is now merged as a precision-aware negative
boundary. The new ledger attaches an explicit uniform synthesis-error budget to
the 270 after-side arbitrary numeric rotations in `gcm_h6`. Under a
Ross-Selinger-style proxy, the most lenient tested total synthesis-error budget
0.1 implies average arbitrary-rotation T cost 35, not below the fixed 20-cost
assumption, and the best tested precision-budget row reaches only 1.079316x
portfolio min STV. The one-sided after-row target would require average
arbitrary-rotation cost <=17 for 1.20x and <=16 for 1.25x, which would require
an impossible >1 total error budget under this proxy. The QASM reuse probe,
however, finds 270 numeric rotation occurrences but only 26 unique numeric
parameters/instructions.

**Next PR:** `T-B7-005` should attack `gcm_h6` structurally: merge or cancel
repeated numeric rotations, test a shared-synthesis/cache proxy for repeated
angles, or prove that the remaining repeated numeric rotations cannot be
reduced by local phase passes.

**Sprint update 8:** `T-B7-005` is now merged as a conservative structural
negative boundary. The pass applies only same-axis numeric rotation
merge/cancel across operations on disjoint qubits, emits 172 certificate
events, and passes a 1/1 Aer measurement-distribution cross-check with TVD
0.0 on `gcm_h6`. It does not remove any arbitrary numeric rotations:
270 -> 270, and the FT T ledger remains 6224 -> 6224. The portfolio min row
therefore stays `gcm_h6` / throughput-heavy factories at 1.086008x STV.

**Next PR:** `T-B7-006` must be nonlocal: either a phase-polynomial or
template-aware compression pass for the `gcm_h6` repeated-angle blocks, or a
proof-quality memo showing that shared synthesis/cache of repeated angles only
saves classical compile effort and cannot reduce the fault-tolerant T ledger.

**Sprint update 9:** `T-B7-006` is now merged as a shared-synthesis/cache
boundary result. The repeated numeric rotations in `gcm_h6` compress from
270 occurrences to 26 unique numeric instruction templates, a 10.384615x
classical catalog reduction. Under the physical occurrence-injection model,
however, every executed arbitrary rotation still consumes an FT rotation
injection, so cache reuse removes 0 T-ledger units and the physical ledger
remains 6760 -> 6224 with portfolio min STV 1.086008x. An intentionally
invalid after-only unique-template accounting would make `gcm_h6` look like it
clears 1.20x, but it still fails the all-variant portfolio gate and is not a
valid physical resource model.

**Next PR:** `T-B7-007` should stop treating repeated-angle cache as a physical
resource reduction and instead attempt a nonlocal repeated-block rewrite:
phase-polynomial, template-aware cancellation, shared magic-state gadget with a
valid execution model, or a sharper no-go certificate for the `gcm_h6` block
family.

**Sprint update 10:** `T-B7-007` is now merged as a nonlocal repeated-block
scan. The scanner emits 2633 role-normalized template certificates over window
widths 8-64. The best exact repeated template, `w8_21`, has width 8, appears
20 non-overlapping times, contains 5 arbitrary rotations per occurrence, and
covers 100 physical arbitrary-rotation occurrences across 14 qubit bindings.
However, the scan finds 0 adjacent inverse block pairs and 0 adjacent duplicate
same-binding block pairs, so it emits no semantics-preserving QASM rewrite:
arbitrary rotations remain 270 -> 270 and T ledger remains 6224 -> 6224. The
target sweep says `gcm_h6` alone reaches 1.20x after removing 30 arbitrary
occurrences / 600 T ledger units, but all-variant 1.20x is still not reached by
changing `gcm_h6` alone because the old `sat_n11` row becomes the minimum at
1.121827x.

**Next PR:** `T-B7-008` should synthesize the best template `w8_21` as an
actual small unitary block. The acceptance gate is strict: either replace each
executed block with fewer than 5 arbitrary rotations and prove equivalence, or
produce a basis-specific minimality/no-go certificate for that template family.

**Sprint update 11:** `T-B7-008` is now merged as a same-skeleton exact
small-block synthesis probe for `w8_21`. The probe tested 55 one-fixed-angle
exact/Clifford candidates, with 16 numerical seeds per candidate, while
re-optimizing the other four angles inside the same two-CNOT skeleton. No
candidate preserved the target 2-qubit unitary within the strict 1e-8
tolerance. The best near miss fixes `a = pi/2`, has residual norm
3.936333737388844e-02 and max entry error 1.8235495914643154e-02. The
finite-difference Jacobian has numerical rank 5, supporting that this
same-skeleton family carries five independent continuous degrees. This closes
the direct one-arbitrary-rotation exact-angle replacement path, but it is not a
global two-qubit lower bound.

**Next PR:** `T-B7-009` should broaden beyond the same two-CNOT skeleton:
KAK/COSINE-style synthesis, alternate CNOT placements, or a sharper
template-family minimality note. A positive result must emit a QASM rewrite for
the 20 non-overlapping `w8_21` occurrences and then rerun proof/Aer/resource
checks.

**Sprint update 12:** `T-B7-009` has now completed a bounded broad-skeleton
exhaustive scan. The new tool scans all length-6 circuits with two CNOTs placed
anywhere, either CNOT direction, and four arbitrary Rz/Ry rotations on either
qubit: 15360 skeleton families, two seeds per family, for 30720 optimizer runs.
It found 0 exact four-arbitrary-rotation candidates; the best candidate
`ry_q1-cx01-rz_q1-cx01-rz_q1-ry_q1` has residual norm 0.24437773599006635 and
max entry error 0.12522813855335146, far above the 1e-8 exact gate. This is a
bounded negative result for this Rz/Ry + two-CNOT + four-rotation family, not a
global lower bound.

**Follow-up completed below:** `T-B7-009` continued with a target-informed
Euler-local family, then with a bounded three-CNOT/four-arbitrary family, and
then with a scoped minimality note that states which searched families were
exhausted.

**Sprint update 13:** `T-B7-009` now has a second, more target-aware negative
boundary. The new tool `tools/b7_w8_21_euler_local_search.py` tests a bounded
Euler-local two-CNOT family with pre/mid/post local `Rz-Ry-Rz` layers on both
qubits. The official run uses target-informed enumeration: it preserves the
source `w8_21` fixed `pi` scaffold, keeps at least 3 of the 5 source arbitrary
angle slots free, allows one remaining free slot to move into nearby Euler-local
structure, and optimizes 500/500 families with 6 seeds each for 3000 optimizer
runs. It found 0 exact four-arbitrary-angle candidates at 1e-8 tolerance. The
best family is
`cx01-cx01|fixed[mid:q1:rz1=pi]|free[pre:q1:ry,mid:q1:rz0,post:q1:rz0,post:q1:ry]`
with residual norm 0.24437773599006604 and max entry error
0.1252281345437596. This strengthens the broad-skeleton negative result by
allowing Euler-local structure around the CNOTs, but it still does not prove a
global KAK lower bound or exclude all Clifford scaffolds, three-CNOT circuits,
ancillas, or measurements.

**Follow-up completed below:** the bounded three-CNOT/four-arbitrary-angle
search has been run, and the scoped minimality note now records why no B7
resource claim can count a `w8_21` rewrite from the tested families.

**Sprint update 14:** the bounded three-CNOT branch of `T-B7-009` is now also
complete. `tools/b7_w8_21_three_cnot_search.py` tests target-informed
pre/mid1/mid2/post local `Rz-Ry-Rz` Euler layers with three CNOTs, four free
arbitrary angles, and the original source `pi` scaffold fixed. The official
run exhausts 1480/1480 families with 6 seeds each, for 8880 optimizer runs.
It found 0 exact candidates at 1e-8 tolerance. The best family is
`cx01-cx10-cx10|fixed[mid1:q1:rz1=pi]|free[mid1:q1:rz0,mid1:q1:ry,post:q0:rz0,post:q1:rz0]`,
with residual norm 1.0352761804100845 and max entry error
0.4895711241454502. Within the tested target-informed family, adding one extra
CNOT does not rescue the attempted 5-to-4 arbitrary-angle compression.

**Next PR:** stop expanding `w8_21` numerical searches unless a new symbolic
KAK/Clifford-scaffold argument is specified. Convert T-B7-008/T-B7-009 into a
scoped minimality note and claim-boundary paper fragment: same-skeleton
one-fixed-angle search, two-CNOT/four-Rz-Ry broad skeleton, two-CNOT
target-informed Euler-local search, and three-CNOT target-informed
Euler-local search all failed to produce a verified four-arbitrary-angle
replacement, so B7 cannot count any `w8_21` resource reduction from these
families.

**Sprint update 17:** `T-B7-009` is now merged as a claim-boundary closure.
The new fragment `research/B7_w8_21_claim_boundary_fragment.md` converts the
four negative search families into a paper-ready boundary statement: repeated
synthesis templates are not physical resource savings unless they come with an
occurrence-removing certificate. Across 43480 optimizer runs, the tested
families found 0 exact four-arbitrary-angle replacements, so `w8_21` removes
0 arbitrary rotations and 0 proxy-T ledger units in B7. This closes the local
numeric `w8_21` expansion path. The next useful work is symbolic
KAK/Clifford-scaffold proof, a certified alternate rewrite for `gcm_h6`, or a
return to `T-B1-004`.

## B8: Classical Verification of Quantum Outputs

**Technical target:** keep verifier soundness low under adaptive leakage by
using challenge refresh and projection rotation.

**Sprint hypothesis:** the toy repair result should survive when embedded in
B4 circuit-level hidden tasks.

**Algorithmic move:** extend the adaptive leakage spoofer to observe partial
history, infer candidate invariants, and attack refreshed B4/B8 circuit tasks.

**Next PR:** `T-B8-001`. Expected artifacts:

- `tools/b8_circuit_adaptive_spoofer.py`
- `results/B8_circuit_adaptive_spoofer_v0.json`
- `research/B8_circuit_adaptive_spoofer.md`

**Acceptance gate:** soundness curves are reported across leakage fractions,
refresh intervals, projection rotations, and spoofer families.

**Failure value:** if high leakage still wins, formalize a minimum-refresh or
rotation-rate burden for B10-T2 instead of claiming a robust verifier.

**Sprint update 19:** `T-B8-001` is now merged together with `T-B4-001` through
the shared B4/B8 circuit refresh task. The adaptive suite covers
metadata-only, known-projection replay, surrogate projection learner, and
trap-aware leakage spoofers. It reproduces the 0.75 leakage failure when
refresh is absent, then shows projection rotation, challenge refresh, and
refresh-plus-rotation all pass the <=5% high-leakage soundness gate in this
CNOT hidden-projection proxy. Next: replace heuristic projection-enforcement
spoofers with trained/generative attackers and connect the minimum-refresh
condition to B10-T2.

**Sprint update 20:** `T-B8-002` is now merged as a trained/generative
spoofer boundary, not as a soundness proof. The new tool
`tools/b8_generative_spoofer_refresh.py` trains correlation-style projection
generators against the B4/B8 circuit-refresh proxy. The official run emits
`results/B8_generative_spoofer_refresh_v0.json` and
`research/B8_generative_spoofer_refresh.md`: 144 configurations, minimum honest
completeness 1.0, maximum learned soundness 1.0, no-refresh high leakage marked
unsafe, and `projection_rotation`, `challenge_refresh`, and
`refresh_plus_rotation` marked safe under this proxy. This gives B10-T2 a
concrete minimum-refresh proof obligation: no sampling-advantage verification
claim should pass through the B4/B8 layer unless projection rotation or a
stronger refresh condition is explicit.

**Sprint update 21:** `T-B10-002` is now merged as a proof-obligation gate, not
as a soundness lemma. The new tool
`tools/b10_t2_refresh_proof_obligation_gate.py` consumes the B8 trained-spoofer
stress result and the B10 formal target card, then emits
`results/B10_t2_refresh_proof_obligation_gate_v0.json` and
`research/B10_t2_refresh_proof_obligation_gate.md`. The gate rejects
no-refresh high-leakage verification claims in the current proxy because
learned soundness reaches 1.0 at lambda=0.75. It records
`projection_rotation`, `challenge_refresh`, and `refresh_plus_rotation` as
admissible next-proof conditions under the 5% proxy gate, but explicitly marks
the lemma status as `not_proved_proxy_insufficient_for_general_soundness`.
Seven open proof obligations remain: formal protocol timing, leakage-channel
definition, adversary class, soundness bound, hardware randomized-measurement
instantiation, separation from sampling-hardness assumptions, and verifier
overhead accounting.

**Sprint update 22:** `T-B10-003` is now merged on the restricted-lemma path,
not the hardware-verifier path. The new tool
`tools/b10_t2_restricted_soundness_lemma.py` emits
`results/B10_t2_restricted_soundness_lemma_v0.json` and
`research/B10_t2_restricted_soundness_lemma.md`. The lemma states that, in a
bounded-leakage transcript model where challenge refresh or projection rotation
leaves at least one verifier predicate unknown and independent of the
adversary, Hoeffding gives adversarial pass probability at most
`exp(-N(mu-tau)^2/2)` for that predicate. With the current proxy parameters
`N=4096`, `mu=0.30`, and `tau=0.08`, the single-unknown-mask bound is
`8.94e-44`, well below the 5% soundness gate. This is explicitly not a
hardware randomized-measurement verifier, cryptographic soundness theorem,
sampling-hardness proof, or BQP/classical separation; it only discharges the
restricted refresh-independence proof obligation.

**Sprint update 23:** `T-B10-004` is now merged on the transcript-simulator
path, not the hardware-verifier path. The new tool
`tools/b10_t2_transcript_leakage_simulator.py` emits
`results/B10_t2_transcript_leakage_simulator_v0.json` and
`research/B10_t2_transcript_leakage_simulator.md`. It runs 192 configurations
over four refresh modes, four leakage fractions, three CNOT hidden-projection
tasks, and four adversary families. Honest completeness is 1.0. No-refresh
high leakage remains unsafe. In refresh-independent high-leakage modes,
`projection_rotation`, `challenge_refresh`, and `refresh_plus_rotation` retain
at least 6 unknown independent predicates, and the maximum empirical soundness
is 0.025. This supports the restricted lemma's transcript assumptions in this
proxy, but it is still not a hardware randomized-measurement verifier,
sampling-hardness proof, cryptographic soundness theorem, or BQP/classical
separation. Next: `T-B10-005` should instantiate hardware-executable
randomized-measurement circuits or a device-noise transcript bridge and attack
that channel with unrestricted learned/generative adversaries.

**Sprint update 24:** `T-B10-005` is now merged as a device-noise transcript
bridge, not as hardware execution. The new tool
`tools/b10_t2_device_noise_transcript_bridge.py` emits
`results/B10_t2_device_noise_transcript_bridge_v0.json` and
`research/B10_t2_device_noise_transcript_bridge.md`. It runs 480 configurations
across five transcript-level noise profiles. Bounded bridge profiles preserve
honest completeness 1.0, and `challenge_refresh` / `refresh_plus_rotation`
keep high-leakage empirical soundness at most 0.0208 with at least 7 unknown
independent predicates. `projection_rotation` is now marked margin-sensitive:
under `low_noise_bridge` it reaches 0.0625 against the oracle-cover spoofer,
so it should not be counted as device-noise bridge-safe without extra margin.
The `calibration_side_channel` profile is rejected. Next: `T-B10-006` should
instantiate hardware-executable randomized-measurement circuits or a Qiskit/Aer
circuit-level verifier bridge.

**Sprint update 25:** `T-B10-006` is now merged as an ideal Qiskit/Aer
circuit-level verifier bridge, not as hardware execution. The new tool
`tools/b10_t2_qiskit_aer_verifier_bridge.py` emits
`results/B10_t2_qiskit_aer_verifier_bridge_v0.json` and
`research/B10_t2_qiskit_aer_verifier_bridge.md`. It instantiates randomized
parity-verifier circuits with ancilla challenge flips for the three B10-T2
CNOT hidden-projection tasks and runs 216 Aer circuits across
`projection_rotation`, `challenge_refresh`, and `refresh_plus_rotation`. The
ideal Aer semantic mismatch count is 0, minimum honest completeness is 1.0,
and the largest circuit uses 30 qubits including verifier ancillas. The
adversary/noise soundness is inherited from the device-noise transcript bridge:
`challenge_refresh` / `refresh_plus_rotation` remain at 0.0208 high-leakage
max soundness, while `projection_rotation` remains margin-sensitive. Next:
`T-B10-007` should add noisy Aer/backend-calibrated circuit execution or
circuit-level adversary generation.

**Sprint update 26:** `T-B10-007` is now merged as a noisy Qiskit/Aer
circuit-level verifier bridge, still not as calibrated backend or hardware
execution. The new tool `tools/b10_t2_noisy_aer_verifier_bridge.py` emits
`results/B10_t2_noisy_aer_verifier_bridge_v0.json` and
`research/B10_t2_noisy_aer_verifier_bridge.md`. It executes 9600 noisy Aer
randomized parity-verifier circuits for the 12-qubit B10-T2 task, using
honest inputs plus four circuit-level adversary input families constructed by
choosing adversarial output bit strings and inverting the CNOT task map. Under
the bridge-safe `challenge_refresh` / `refresh_plus_rotation` modes, bounded
noise profiles keep noisy honest acceptance at 1.0 and noisy adversary
acceptance at 0.0, with max honest predicate-bit error 0.1125 and at least 7
unknown independent predicates. The `calibration_side_channel` profile remains
rejected. Next: `T-B10-008` should add backend-calibrated noise parameters or
real hardware randomized-measurement verifier execution.

**Sprint update 27:** `T-B10-008` is now merged as a backend-calibrated-style
Aer verifier bridge, still not as real backend properties or hardware
execution. The new tool `tools/b10_t2_backend_calibrated_verifier_bridge.py`
emits `results/B10_t2_backend_calibrated_verifier_bridge_v0.json` and
`research/B10_t2_backend_calibrated_verifier_bridge.md`. It derives
per-qubit readout errors and per-gate depolarizing errors from Qiskit
`GenericBackendV2` target `InstructionProperties`, then executes 5760
randomized parity-verifier circuits across three calibration snapshots. Under
the bridge-safe `challenge_refresh` / `refresh_plus_rotation` modes, calibrated
honest acceptance remains 1.0, calibrated adversary acceptance is 0.25, max
honest predicate-bit error is 0.0703125, and at least 7 unknown independent
predicates remain. The no-refresh mode remains unsafe. Next: `T-B10-009`
should replace GenericBackendV2 snapshots with real backend properties or run
hardware randomized-measurement verifier execution.

## B9: Quantum PCP / Local Hamiltonian Hardness

**Technical target:** extract a restricted theorem or negative lemma from the
gap-amplification lab.

**Sprint hypothesis:** a failed small-instance amplification pattern can become
a useful negative lemma if the locality, normalization, and gap measurements
are stated precisely.

**Algorithmic move:** choose one counterexample family, write the attempted
amplification rule, identify the violated condition, and package it as a proof
obligation.

**Next PR:** `T-B9-001`. Expected artifacts:

- `research/B9_failed_gap_amplification_lemma.md`
- `results/B9_failed_gap_amplification_lemma_v0.json`
- optional proof-check notes

**Acceptance gate:** the lemma names assumptions, shows the counterexample
family, and states exactly what broader Quantum PCP claim it does not resolve.

**Failure value:** even a failed proof becomes a reusable barrier record.

**Sprint update 28:** `T-B9-001` is now merged as a finite-instance negative
lemma extracted from the B9 exact gap lab. The new tool
`tools/b9_failed_gap_amplification_lemma.py` consumes
`results/B9_local_hamiltonian_gap_lab_v0.json` and emits
`results/B9_failed_gap_amplification_lemma_v0.json` plus
`research/B9_failed_gap_amplification_lemma.md`. The lemma states that raw
spectral-gap growth is not an acceptable local-Hamiltonian gap-amplification
certificate unless locality, ground-space overlap, and normalized-gap
improvement are checked together. The current v0 screen has 0 accepted local
candidate rows, 4 strict width-trap counterexamples, 9 dense locality traps,
and 5 proof obligations. It explicitly does not claim a Quantum PCP proof,
NLTS theorem, local-Hamiltonian hardness theorem, or global gap-amplification
impossibility. Next: `T-B9-002` should turn this finite-instance failed-proof
record into a symbolic family statement or proof-assistant skeleton.

**Sprint update 29:** `T-B9-002` is now merged as a symbolic/proof-assistant
skeleton, still not as a checked formal theorem. The new tool
`tools/b9_symbolic_gap_skeleton.py` consumes
`results/B9_failed_gap_amplification_lemma_v0.json` and emits
`results/B9_symbolic_gap_skeleton_v0.json`,
`research/B9_symbolic_gap_skeleton.md`, and
`research/proof_skeletons/B9_failed_gap_amplification_skeleton.lean`. The
Lean-style skeleton defines `LocalHamiltonianFamily`, `LocalTransform`,
`RawGapAmplifies`, `NormalizedGapAmplifies`, and `AcceptableLocalGapStep`,
then records three theorem skeletons separating raw-gap growth, normalized-gap
failure, and locality failure. It carries forward five open obligations from
the finite-instance lemma, inherits four strict counterexamples and nine dense
locality traps, and explicitly remains unchecked by Lean/mathlib. Next:
`T-B9-003` should instantiate the skeleton on a named Hamiltonian family with
analytic width/locality bounds, then run an actual proof-check pass.

**Sprint update 30:** `T-B9-003` is now merged as a named-family
width/locality bound skeleton, still not as a checked theorem. The new tool
`tools/b9_named_family_width_locality_bounds.py` consumes
`results/B9_local_hamiltonian_gap_lab_v0.json` and emits
`results/B9_named_family_width_locality_bounds_v0.json`,
`research/B9_named_family_width_locality_bounds.md`, and
`research/proof_skeletons/B9_cluster_stabilizer_width_locality_bound.lean`.
The named family is `cluster_stabilizer_open_uniform_reweight`: for n=4,5,6
all generated open-boundary cluster-stabilizer terms have support 2 or 3, so
`local_interaction_reweight_v0` multiplies every term uniformly by 1.35. The
raw spectral gap therefore grows, max locality stays 3, and spectral width
scales by the same factor, leaving normalized gap invariant. The resulting
certificate is rejected as global energy rescaling, not a Quantum PCP proof or
global no-go theorem. A proof-check was attempted, but the current `lean`
command on PATH is not a usable Lean/mathlib theorem prover in this workspace.
Next: `T-B9-004` should create a real proof-checkable environment and
formalize the support-size, uniform-scaling, spectral-width, and
normalized-gap lemmas for all n >= 4.

## B10: Boundary of BQP

**Technical target:** separate robust quantum advantage claims from hidden
input, oracle, loading, verification, precision, or output-cost assumptions.

**Sprint hypothesis:** B10's most valuable near-term contribution is not a
BQP/classical separation. It is an explicit boundary theorem or denominator
comparison for one advantage claim linked to B3/B5/B8.

**Algorithmic move:** use the completed B3/B5 denominator boundary comparison
as a theorem-note scaffold, and in parallel move B10-T2 from GenericBackendV2
calibration-style simulator evidence into real-backend properties or hardware
randomized-measurement verification.

**Current evidence:** `T-B10-001` is merged: 4 B3/B5 route cards, B3
selected-CI larger-basis denominator wins 0, B3 max optimizer-loop shots lower
bound 475,043,013,690,000, B5 non-oracle-over-oracle rows 4,
seeded-MPS-over-non-oracle rows 6, variational MPS/ALS-over-seeded rows 0, and
no BQP separation or quantum advantage claim.
`T-B10-010` is also merged: 2 theorem skeletons, 5 missing assumptions, and 5
proof obligations; it is not a dequantization theorem, sampling-access theorem,
BQP separation, or quantum advantage claim.
`T-B10-011` is now merged: 2 B3/B5 family contracts, 8
explicit/oracle/sampling/quantum access rows, 5 bridge conditions, and a
current-evidence refutation of the sampling-access bridge. It is not a general
dequantization theorem, sampling-access theorem, BQP separation, or quantum
advantage claim.
`T-B10-012` is now merged: 4 B5 denominator ladder rows, 5 sampling
requirements that all block the current bridge, 6 seeded-MPS-over-non-oracle
rows, 0 variational-over-seeded rows, no sampling oracle, no production DMRG,
and no same-access positive route.
`T-B5-004` now feeds `T-B10-013`: the two-site finite-DMRG-style prototype
beats one-site ALS on 4 rows but still beats seeded MPS pressure on 0 rows, so
the same-access bridge remains blocked until production DMRG/MPS or a fully
costed response sampler exists.

**Next PR:** `T-B10-013` or `T-B10-009`. Expected artifacts:

- `research/B10_t1_b5_production_dmrg_response_reference.md` or `research/B10_t1_b5_sampling_oracle_stress.md`
- `results/B10_t1_b5_production_dmrg_response_reference_v0.json` or `results/B10_t1_b5_sampling_oracle_stress_v0.json`
- `research/B4_B8_hardware_randomized_verifier.md` or `research/B10_t2_real_backend_verifier_bridge.md`
- `results/B4_B8_hardware_randomized_verifier_v0.json` or `results/B10_t2_real_backend_verifier_bridge_v0.json`
- optional update to `research/B10_formal_theorem_targets.md`

**Acceptance gate:** a theorem target, proof attempt, counterexample, or
denominator comparison states the input model, output model, verifier burden,
and classical baseline.

**Failure value:** if the target cannot be proven, the failed proof should
still identify which assumption is too strong or too weak.

## Sprint Promotion Matrix

| B9/B10 | Theory note possible if negative lemma/proof target is precise. | Usually not the lead route. | Boundary checker can become a claim-audit tool. |

## Immediate Assignment Order

1. `compiler-agent`: B1 native T-resource optimizer.
2. `ft-agent`: B7 min-STV regime classifier waiting on B1 output.
3. `qec-agent`: B2 shot-conditioned erasure decoder or calibrated leakage model.
4. `verification-agent`: B4/B8 hidden task generator and adaptive spoofer.
5. `chemistry-agent`: B3 reaction observable circuit vs FCI denominator.
6. `theory-agent`: B10-T2 real-backend/hardware verifier bridge plus B9 negative lemma.
7. `materials-agent`: B6 computed descriptor audit with expanded negatives.

This sprint is complete only when at least one PR-quality artifact exists for
each spine and the portfolio audit still passes.

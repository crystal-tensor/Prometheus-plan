# B1/B7 Cone01 R67 Accepted-Exit-Route Submission Contract Gate

- Target: `T-B1-004fq/T-B7-014z`
- Upstream target: `T-B1-004fp/T-B7-014y`
- Method: `b1_b7_cone01_r67_exit_route_submission_contract_gate_v0`
- Status: `cone01_r67_exit_route_submission_contract_emitted_zero_credit`
- Contract hash: `99e50d8c04bbb0b7435f4867d965b20376fd5c0685319a0b87a0ba9dad61f0a0`

## Result

R67 passes 8/8 requirements by emitting the accepted-exit-route contract and rejecting the placeholder template. It creates a PR target, not an accepted route.

## Evidence

- Route classes: `3`
- Required submission fields: `29`
- Placeholder fields rejected: `23`
- Preflight passed: `False`
- Accepted exit routes: `0`
- Accepted occurrence removal: `0`
- Accepted proxy-T reduction: `0`
- B7 nonzero retest allowed: `False`
- B7 credit delta: `0`

## Requirement Results

- `E1` PASS: R66 upstream completed the zero-credit B7 retest boundary
- `E2` PASS: R67 contract defines R1/R2/R3 exit-route classes
- `E3` PASS: R67 contract requires full-circuit or route-bounded replay evidence
- `E4` PASS: R67 contract requires no-double-counting, line1381, line1378, and delta ledgers
- `E5` PASS: R67 template is emitted but rejected as a placeholder
- `E6` PASS: R67 preserves zero B7 credit and blocks nonzero retest
- `E7` PASS: R67 forbids row-level denominator evidence from counting alone
- `E8` PASS: R67 artifacts are hash-bound and written

## Claim Boundary

- Supported: R67 emits a hash-bound accepted-exit-route submission contract, template, and placeholder preflight rejection for the post-R66 path.
- Not supported: R67 does not accept an exit route, prove a full-circuit rewrite, allow reroute, or grant any B7 ledger credit.
- Next gate: Fill the R67 template with source-backed replay, no-double-counting, line1381/line1378, occurrence-delta, and proxy-T-delta evidence.

## Remaining Open Obligations

- `filled_exit_route_submission`
- `machine_checked_full_circuit_or_route_bounded_replay`
- `nonzero_occurrence_and_proxy_t_delta`
- `downstream_nonzero_b7_ledger_retest`

- validation_error_count: `0`

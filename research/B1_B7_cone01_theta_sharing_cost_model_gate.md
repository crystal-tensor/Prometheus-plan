# B1/B7 Cone_01 Theta-Sharing Physical Cost-Model Gate

Status: `cone01_theta_sharing_cost_model_not_accepted`

This artifact asks whether the repeated-theta cache signal from T-B1-004f can already be promoted into a physical B7 cost model. The answer is no. A shared synthesis object proposal now exists for the four theta groups, a line-level replay verifier covers the shared objects, and a logical layout/routing scaffold assigns anchors and route packets. The current evidence still lacks occurrence-removing certificates, physical device layout, factory amortization, error budget, independent baseline, and refreshed B7 ledger.

It is not a rewrite certificate, not a resource-saving claim, and not a physical cost-model acceptance.

## Acceptance Gates

| gate | requirement | current evidence | required evidence | passed |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| CM-01 | At least 30 replayable occurrence-removing semantic certificates. | `0` | `30` | `False` |
| CM-02 | A shared synthesis object that replaces repeated theta occurrences, not only a classical template label. | `4` | `4` | `True` |
| CM-03 | A replay verifier for the shared-theta object across all affected windows. | `4` | `4` | `True` |
| CM-04 | An explicit layout/routing model showing where the shared object lives and how windows consume it. | `4` | `True` | `True` |
| CM-05 | A factory-amortization model proving lower T-factory pressure under the shared object. | `False` | `True` | `False` |
| CM-06 | A synthesis-error and correlation budget for shared theta reuse. | `False` | `True` | `False` |
| CM-07 | An independent baseline showing cache-only accounting is not double-counting occurrence cost. | `False` | `True` | `False` |
| CM-08 | A refreshed B7 FT ledger that accepts the model and improves the gcm_h6 min row. | `False` | `True` | `False` |

## Interpretation

The repeated-theta structure is valuable because it identifies where a future physical-sharing proposal would have leverage. The shared object proposal, replay verifier, and logical layout/routing scaffold close three bookkeeping gaps, but they are not enough by themselves. A future PR must satisfy the remaining gates, or bypass the cost-model route by producing 30 occurrence-removing certificates.

# B9 Proof-Environment Contract Gate

Status: **proof_environment_contract_open_not_formal_theorem**

## Summary

T-B9-004c converts the blocked proof-environment readiness gate into five PR-sized proof packets. This is a handoff contract, not a formal theorem, Quantum PCP proof, NLTS proof, or global gap-amplification impossibility claim.

## Contract Metrics

- Named family: `cluster_stabilizer_open_uniform_reweight`
- Source failed gates: PE-03, PE-04, PE-05, PE-08, PE-09
- Source readiness passed / failed: 4 / 5
- Lean / Lake / project / placeholder: 1 / False / False / True
- Contract requirements passed / failed: 3 / 5
- Contract packets: 5

## Requirements

| ID | Pass | Requirement | Evidence | Missing to promote |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| K1 | yes | source proof-environment gate is present and bounded | benchmark_id=B9; method=b9_proof_environment_readiness_gate_v0; status=proof_environment_readiness_blocked_not_formal_theorem; family=cluster_stabilizer_open_uniform_reweight; failed=['PE-03', 'PE-04', 'PE-05', 'PE-08', 'PE-09'] | Keep this contract tied to the failed B9 proof-environment readiness gate. |
| K2 | yes | local verifier evidence remains clean | validation_error_count=0; local_verifier_checked=True; passed_gate_count=4 | Preserve local exact-rational evidence as the non-formal denominator. |
| K3 | yes | forbidden theorem claims are absent | no_forbidden_claims=True | Keep B9 in theorem-readiness mode until independent proof checking passes. |
| K4 | no | Lean executable succeeds | lean_available=True; lean_return_code=1 | Pin a Lean 4 executable that returns success for the project. |
| K5 | no | Lake executable succeeds | lake_available=False; lake_return_code=None | Pin Lake and make it available to the proof project. |
| K6 | no | Lake/mathlib project files are present | present_files=[] | Add lean-toolchain plus lakefile.lean or lakefile.toml with mathlib dependency. |
| K7 | no | named-family theorem is not a placeholder | contains_placeholder_true_theorem=True | Replace the True theorem with an indexed Hamiltonian-family statement. |
| K8 | no | formal theorem is proof-assistant checked | proof_assistant_checked=False; formal_theorem_proved=False | Record checked theorem output before upgrading the B9 claim. |

## PR Packets

### B9-PE03-lean-toolchain

- Source gate: PE-03
- Title: Pin a successful Lean executable
- Acceptance: lean --version exits successfully
- Acceptance: toolchain version is recorded
- Acceptance: local verifier artifacts remain unchanged
- Claim boundary: Packet evidence may improve B9 formal-readiness only after audit; it must not claim Quantum PCP, NLTS, local-Hamiltonian hardness, a formal theorem, or a global gap-amplification impossibility result until the proof environment and the theorem itself are independently checked.

### B9-PE04-lake-tooling

- Source gate: PE-04
- Title: Pin Lake tooling
- Acceptance: lake --version exits successfully
- Acceptance: Lake version is recorded
- Acceptance: the command runs from the repository root
- Claim boundary: Packet evidence may improve B9 formal-readiness only after audit; it must not claim Quantum PCP, NLTS, local-Hamiltonian hardness, a formal theorem, or a global gap-amplification impossibility result until the proof environment and the theorem itself are independently checked.

### B9-PE05-mathlib-project

- Source gate: PE-05
- Title: Create a Lean/Lake/mathlib project
- Acceptance: lean-toolchain is present
- Acceptance: lakefile.lean or lakefile.toml is present
- Acceptance: mathlib dependency is declared or vendored reproducibly
- Claim boundary: Packet evidence may improve B9 formal-readiness only after audit; it must not claim Quantum PCP, NLTS, local-Hamiltonian hardness, a formal theorem, or a global gap-amplification impossibility result until the proof environment and the theorem itself are independently checked.

### B9-PE08-indexed-theorem

- Source gate: PE-08
- Title: Replace the placeholder True theorem
- Acceptance: named-family theorem quantifies n >= 4
- Acceptance: Hamiltonian family, support, locality, width, and normalized gap are explicit
- Acceptance: no placeholder True theorem remains
- Claim boundary: Packet evidence may improve B9 formal-readiness only after audit; it must not claim Quantum PCP, NLTS, local-Hamiltonian hardness, a formal theorem, or a global gap-amplification impossibility result until the proof environment and the theorem itself are independently checked.

### B9-PE09-checked-formal-output

- Source gate: PE-09
- Title: Record proof-assistant checked theorem output
- Acceptance: proof_assistant_checked is true
- Acceptance: formal_theorem_proved is true for the restricted theorem
- Acceptance: claim boundary still says this is not Quantum PCP or NLTS
- Claim boundary: Packet evidence may improve B9 formal-readiness only after audit; it must not claim Quantum PCP, NLTS, local-Hamiltonian hardness, a formal theorem, or a global gap-amplification impossibility result until the proof environment and the theorem itself are independently checked.

## Claim Boundary

- No formal theorem is claimed.
- No Quantum PCP or NLTS theorem is claimed.
- No global gap-amplification impossibility theorem is claimed.
- The local verifier remains useful evidence, but it is not a proof assistant.
- The B9 route remains a restricted negative-result track until the contract packets close.

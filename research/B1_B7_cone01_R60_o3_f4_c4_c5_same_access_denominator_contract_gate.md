# B1/B7 Cone01 R60 O3-F4 C4/C5 Same-Access Denominator Contract Gate

- Target: `T-B1-004fj/T-B7-014s`
- Upstream target: `T-B1-004fi/T-B7-014r`
- Method: `b1_b7_cone01_r60_o3_f4_c4_c5_same_access_denominator_contract_gate_v0`
- Status: `cone01_r60_c4_c5_same_access_denominator_contract_emitted_zero_b7_credit`
- R60 contract hash: `2f1eea9d7fcc32e8cfeff6069d5fd351013b428586abff90c115c20b40812c2b`

## Result

R60 passes 8/8 contract requirements by emitting the C4/C5 same-access denominator schema and 8 row-level submission templates. It accepts 0 denominator rows, so C4/C5, C6, C7, O3 closure, reroute, and B7 ledger credit remain blocked.

## Contract Evidence

- Row count: `8`
- Template count: `8`
- Required acceptance fields per row: `24`
- Submitted denominator rows: `0`
- Accepted denominator rows: `0`
- Blocked denominator rows: `8`
- C4/C5 contract emitted: `True`
- C4/C5 comparison complete: `False`
- B7 credit delta: `0`

## Requirement Results

- `D1` PASS: R59 upstream completed C3 for all 8 rows and still has zero B7 credit
- `D2` PASS: R60 emits one denominator submission template for each R59 row
- `D3` PASS: Each template is bound to the R59 source, candidate, and certificate hashes
- `D4` PASS: The same-access schema forbids hidden traces, external oracles, and unbound inputs
- `D5` PASS: The denominator acceptance schema exposes all required review fields
- `D6` PASS: No denominator row is accepted yet, so C4/C5 stays incomplete
- `D7` PASS: R60 preserves O3/reroute/B7 zero-credit boundaries
- `D8` PASS: The all-row C4/C5 contract bundle is hash-bound

## Claim Boundary

- Supported: R60 turns the C4/C5 same-access denominator requirement into an eight-row submission contract with hash-bound source/candidate/certificate inputs, access-model hashes, forbidden-input rules, and 24 required acceptance fields.
- Not supported: R60 does not submit or accept a denominator row, does not complete C4/C5, does not audit C6 leakage, does not produce a C7 machine-check bundle, and does not grant O3/reroute/B7/STV credit.
- Next gate: Submit source-backed denominator rows under the R60 schema, then run the acceptance verifier before any B7 ledger retest.

## Remaining Open Obligations

- `submit_C4_C5_same_access_denominator_rows`
- `accept_8_denominator_rows_under_R60_schema`
- `C6_leakage_free_optimizer_trace`
- `C7_machine_check_replay_bundle`
- `B7_ledger_retest_after_C4_C7`

- validation_error_count: `0`

R127 enumerates all injective six-logical-to-seven-physical mappings using only
frozen snapshot measurement and CX properties plus each task's logical
two-qubit interaction graph. It then transpiles one all-Z representative per
selected mapping to test whether the static objective predicts lower compiled
exposure than the R125 default layout. No new randomized-measurement holdout is
executed and no mitigation performance claim is made.

## Next Gate

Rank the retained candidates with the transpiler in the optimization loop so
the objective accounts for routing-induced CX overhead. Only after that ranking
passes should a disjoint-seed layout/readout holdout be preregistered.

## Requirements

- `P1` PASS: R125 and R126 source artifacts are hash-bound and consumed
- `P2` PASS: all injective six-to-seven physical mappings are enumerated
- `P3` PASS: the static objective uses only snapshot and task-graph properties
- `P4` PASS: ten ranked mappings are retained per snapshot/task
- `P5` PASS: one selected mapping is transpiled per snapshot/task
- `P6` PASS: selected compiled circuits preserve logical classical-bit order
- `P7` PASS: compiled exposure is compared against every R125 default layout
- `P8` PASS: no acceptance holdout or readout mitigation is executed
- `P9` PASS: historical snapshots remain separate from current and hardware evidence
- `P10` PASS: no soundness, advantage, BQP, or new credit is claimed

## Claim Boundary

Supported: deterministic calibration-aware layout candidates and compiled
exposure comparisons. Not supported: improved verifier completeness, readout
mitigation, current calibration, provider access, hardware execution, protocol
soundness, quantum advantage, BQP separation, or B10 credit.

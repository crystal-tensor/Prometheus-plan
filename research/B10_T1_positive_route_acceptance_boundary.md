## Required Downstream Evidence Before B10-T1 Credit

- accepted B3-R1-full-covariance-row-acceptance-packet or accepted B5B10-W1-priority-row-acceptance-packet
- nonzero accepted B3 full-covariance row count or nonzero accepted B5 production row count
- B3 full-covariance denominator win or B5 production DMRG denominator win under the locked same-access row contract
- optimizer-loop and same-access cost ledger showing a positive route after denominator costs
- B10 access-boundary note replacing zero-credit status with a positive-route ledger
- claim boundary that still forbids reaction-dynamics, production-DMRG, same-access, quantum-advantage, and BQP-separation claims until evidence is source-backed

## Requirement Results

- S1 [PASS]: B3 full-covariance row acceptance packet gate is present and current
- S2 [PASS]: B5 W1 priority-row acceptance packet gate is present and current
- S3 [PASS]: Both source gates remain blocked only on missing submitted acceptance-packet evidence
- S4 [PASS]: B3 full-covariance route remains demoted with no denominator win
- S5 [PASS]: B5 W1 route remains zero-row with no production-DMRG positive route
- S6 [PASS]: Forbidden B10-T1 quantum advantage and BQP claims remain absent across both routes
- S7 [PASS]: B10-T1 unified positive-route credit remains explicitly disabled
- S8 [PASS]: Boundary packet records downstream evidence required before B10-T1 credit

## Claim Boundary

- Supported: B10-T1 is now explicitly synchronized to the B3 full-covariance and B5 W1 priority-row acceptance packet gates as a unified positive-route zero-credit boundary.
- Not supported: No accepted B3 full-covariance row, B5 production row, production DMRG denominator, same-access positive route, quantum advantage, or BQP separation is supported.
- Next gate: Submit and accept either the B3 full-covariance row acceptance packet or the B5 W1 priority-row acceptance packet, then produce a source-backed denominator win and same-access cost ledger before B10-T1 can leave zero-credit status.

## Result

The B3/B10 full-covariance post-boundary triage satisfies 6/6 conditions and emits 5 PR-sized work packets.
Ready external PR packets: F1, F2, F3, F4. Blocked packet: F5.

## Work Packets

| Packet | Status | Blocker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F1 | ready_for_external_pr_not_credit | accepted full-covariance row count is still zero |
| F2 | ready_for_external_pr_not_credit | only one compiled pilot exists and it is not a converged multi-parameter state-prep result |
| F3 | ready_for_external_pr_not_credit | denominator win count remains zero |
| F4 | ready_for_external_pr_not_credit | optimizer-loop lower-bound shots remain 475,043,013,690,000 |
| F5 | blocked_until_F1_F2_F3_F4_evidence | B10-T1 cannot count credit without accepted rows, denominator wins, and same-access replay |

## Evidence Boundary

- Downstream packet: `B3-R1-full-compiled-covariance`
- Row-aligned instances: `4`
- Compiled pilot instances: `1`
- Accepted full-covariance rows: `0`
- Denominator wins: `0`
- Optimizer-loop lower-bound shots: `475043013690000`
- B3 reopen ready: `False`
- B10-T1 credit allowed: `False`

## Claim Boundary

This is a triage result, not a reaction-dynamics result. It does not claim B3 reopen, full-covariance credit, same-access positive route, quantum advantage, BQP separation, or B10-T1 credit.

## Validation

- Validation errors: `0`
- `C1` PASS: Source B3/B10 full-covariance zero-credit boundary is current and valid
- `C2` PASS: The source acceptance packet remains blocked on missing submitted evidence
- `C3` PASS: The B3 full-covariance scope is preserved
- `C4` PASS: Four B3 evidence PR packets are ready for external agents
- `C5` PASS: B10-T1 access-contract acceptance is correctly blocked until F1-F4 evidence exists
- `C6` PASS: Forbidden B3/B10 credit and advantage claims remain false

## Heuristic question

Can a standard-library oracle reproduce the one-ULP policy split without calling Qiskit or importing the R170 executor?

R171 reads only the committed R170 worker manifests. It reconstructs source scores from binary64 bits, compensated sums from retained leaf bits, exact rational leaf sums, and the declared 1-ULP tie rule. It verifies row hashes, candidate records, source-return mappings, all three operation-order profiles, and the aggregate policy split.

## Claim boundary

This is independent evidence integrity and arithmetic recomputation for one frozen R170 input. It is not a new Qiskit execution, a production mapping change, a confirmed bug, cross-input generality, hardware evidence, quantum advantage, BQP separation, solved B4/B8/B10, or new credit.

## Provenance Manifest Packet

- Submission path: `results/B7_w8_21_symbolic_certificate_provenance_manifest_submissions/B7S1-w8-21-symbolic-certificate-provenance-manifest.json`
- Priority packet hash: `c86c79de1b0266fca7affbca1024d1ad4d67a839c4626f872da9d59d9744b48c`

Required evidence files:

- normalized_two_qubit_target_matrix_manifest
- symbolic_coordinate_system_note
- local_invariant_expression_derivation
- tested_scaffold_exclusion_table_source
- uncovered_global_route_statement
- numeric_search_digest_binding_43480_runs
- theorem_or_notebook_environment_manifest
- reproduction_command_manifest
- occurrence_ledger_nonpromotion_note
- claim_boundary_note

Acceptance predicates:

- manifest_id equals B7S1-w8-21-symbolic-certificate-provenance-manifest
- packet_id equals B7-S1-w8-21-symbolic-kak-obstruction
- template_id equals w8_21
- priority_packet_hash matches the source priority packet
- target-matrix, coordinate-system, invariant, exclusion-table, uncovered-route, notebook-environment, and reproduction-command hashes are present
- replay_hashes bind priority_packet_hash, 43,480 prior optimizer runs, and 8,880 three-CNOT attempted runs
- source evidence files are present and hash-bound
- claim_boundary forbids rewrite, global-lower-bound, resource-reduction, and B7-ledger-credit claims

## Requirement Results

- P1 [PASS]: Priority symbolic certificate packet remains valid and blocked only on P6/P7/P8
- P2 [PASS]: Manifest is bound to the w8_21 symbolic KAK obstruction packet
- P3 [PASS]: Manifest packet carries locked provenance schema and evidence file classes
- P4 [PASS]: Numerical negative boundary and target ledger pressure remain preserved
- P5 [PASS]: Current B7 state has no accepted symbolic certificate or ledger credit
- P6 [PASS]: Provenance manifest artifact has been submitted
- P7 [PASS]: Submitted manifest satisfies the locked provenance schema
- P8 [PASS]: Submitted manifest is source-backed, packet-bound, and replay-hash-bound
- P9 [PASS]: Forbidden rewrite, lower-bound, resource, and ledger claims remain false

## Claim Boundary

- Supported: The first B7 w8_21 symbolic certificate route now has a provenance manifest packet that must bind target matrix, symbolic coordinates, local invariants, exclusion tables, notebook environment, and replay hashes before a theory artifact can be accepted.
- Not supported: No provenance manifest or symbolic certificate has been submitted or accepted; no occurrence-removing rewrite, global lower bound, resource reduction, or B7 ledger improvement is supported.
- Next gate: Submit results/B7_w8_21_symbolic_certificate_provenance_manifest_submissions/B7S1-w8-21-symbolic-certificate-provenance-manifest.json before the symbolic certificate JSON artifact, then rerun this gate and the priority packet gate.
- new_rewrite_claimed: False
- global_lower_bound_claimed: False
- physical_resource_reduction_claimed: False
- b7_ledger_improvement_claimed: False

## Validation

- validation_error_count: 0

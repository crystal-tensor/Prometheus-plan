# Axiom Horizon

**An AI Multi-Agent Research Program for Quantum Computing's Hardest Frontiers**

Broader open-source mission: challenge the world's hardest 100 problems through
AI multi-agent research, with a 2-3 year concentrated push on the Top 10
technical frontier tracks.

[Repository target](https://github.com/crystal-tensor/Prometheus-plan)

## Mission

Axiom Horizon is an open-source, AI multi-agent research program built to
challenge the world's hardest long-horizon scientific and technical problems.

The project starts from a living, open map of **100 hard problems**. Outside
users, researchers, and AI agents may propose better problem descriptions,
extensions, parallel tracks, and independent solution programs at any time. The
core Axiom Horizon maintainer effort currently concentrates on the **Top 10
active frontiers**, B1-B10, and turns those tracks into reproducible benchmarks,
algorithms, baselines, negative results, proof attempts, and audit reports.

Our 2-3 year target is not hype. It is a disciplined research goal:

> Build a global, open, AI-assisted research machine that can make credible,
> auditable progress toward solving at least part of the Top 10 frontier
> problems.

We do not claim that any world problem is solved today. We claim that the
project has a structure for making progress that can be reproduced, attacked,
improved, and merged by researchers and AI agents around the world.

## What Makes This Different

Axiom Horizon is not a normal notes repository. It is a research operating
system:

- **Open 100-problem universe**: contributors may open issues or PRs to improve,
  extend, challenge, or launch parallel work on any problem in the catalog.
- **Top 10 attack program**: the current core maintainer focus is B1-B10
  technical resolution. Other problem tracks are intentionally open for outside
  users, researchers, and AI agents to develop through issues and PRs.
- **Multi-agent workflow**: human researchers and AI agents can claim tasks,
  open PRs, and submit reproducible artifacts.
- **Claim boundaries**: every result must say what it does and does not prove.
- **Audit-first culture**: important claims must pass
  `tools/research_portfolio_audit.py`.
- **Translation after evidence**: papers, patents, fundraising, and tools come
  after technical gates, not before.

## Current Status

The project is active and unfinished.

Current evidence includes:

- an open 100-problem catalog with discipline and source-lineage metadata;
- B1-B10 execution boards and detailed dossiers;
- reproducible scripts under `tools/`;
- machine-readable results under `results/`;
- human-readable research notes under `research/`;
- an audit report in `research/portfolio_status_report.md`;
- a current status page in `research/current_stage_brief.html`.

The current B5/B10 line has recently moved from small-cluster denominators to
seeded MPS pressure, non-seeded one-site MPS/ALS pressure, and a two-site
finite-DMRG-style pressure prototype. B5 now has a canonical-DMRG readiness
audit plus a canonical-environment smoke gate over the same 9 B5/B10 D5 Hubbard
response rows: 8 readiness conditions evaluated, 0 passed, 8 failed; the smoke
gate finds 9 environment ledgers, 0 smoke-passed rows, 3 rows passing the
fixed-sector, variance, discarded-weight, and monotonicity checks, 0 rows close
to the seeded MPS pressure response, and 0 rows beating seeded MPS pressure.
The B5/B10 same-access production contract now makes that blocker explicit:
10 contract gates are checked, only row coverage and no-forbidden-claim gates
pass, 8 gates fail, there is still no production DMRG, no sampling oracle,
no same-access positive route, and no BQP or quantum-advantage claim.
The latest B5/B10 production implementation triage gate now splits that failed
contract into six PR-sized work packets: two immediate guardrail packets
(`W4` row-contract preservation and `W6` claim-safety/audit wiring) and four
blocked implementation/theory packets (`W1` production DMRG/MPS denominator,
`W2` seeded-pressure replacement audit, `W3` same-access response-oracle cost
ledger, and `W5` B10-T1 theorem-boundary integration). It satisfies 6/6
triage readiness conditions while keeping production DMRG, sampling oracle,
same-access positive route, catalog change, quantum advantage, and BQP
separation all false.
The W4 row-contract harness is now executed as a machine-checkable guardrail:
it preserves the same 9 D5 Hubbard response rows across 10 B5/B10 source
artifacts, records row-contract hash
`7ee407e20f51bd0c003d885c8d43282359f84bea9729f0da203b9b2c2970a9fc`,
passes 10/10 source checks and 6/6 conditions, and leaves `W1`/`W2`/`W3` as
the only positive-route implementation packets. It is not a new denominator,
not production DMRG, not a response oracle, and not a quantum advantage claim.
The W2 seeded-pressure replacement audit is now also executed. It replays three
candidate replacement families under the locked row contract and finds
0 deployable replacements for the exact-state-seeded MPS pressure reference.
The seeded mean relative response error is `0.0004416259745141553`; the best
replacement-by-mean is `variational_mps_als` at `0.01805548365563228`, with
0 rows beating seeded pressure. The largest row-level win count across all
candidate families is only 2/9, so the seeded-pressure blocker remains explicit
and W2 is closed as a current positive-route packet.
The W3 same-access response-oracle cost ledger is now executed as well. It
checks 8 oracle requirements under the same row contract: 3 pass and 5 fail
(`O3` state preparation, `O4` mixing/query cost, `O5` readout/noise cost,
`O6` optimizer-loop cost, and `O7` denominator win). The measurement-confidence
ledger exists, but no response oracle is constructed, 0 rows beat explicit D5
matvec pressure for the seeded target, and the remaining positive-route packet
is now `W1` production DMRG/MPS.
The W1 production DMRG/MPS acceptance gate is now executed. It checks 10
production-denominator requirements under the locked row contract: 3 pass and
7 fail (`D3` non-exact-state-seeded production denominator, `D4` stored
canonical environments and orthonormal residuals, `D5` full-row convergence
ledgers, `D6` seeded-pressure replacement, `D7` same-access cost ledger, `D8`
B10 positive-route readiness, and `D9` prototype-over-seeded pressure). The
gate preserves all 9 rows and 9 environment-ledger rows, but confirms that W1
is still blocked on the denominator engine itself.
The first W1 denominator-engine ledger is now also executed. It checks 8
denominator-engine requirements under the same row-contract hash: 4 pass and
4 fail (`E4` production canonical environments/residuals, `E5` all-row
convergence, `E6` seeded-pressure replacement, and `E7` same-access production
cost ledger). The ledger preserves all 9 rows and 216 sweep-ledger rows, but
has 0 convergence-passed rows and 0 rows beating seeded pressure. The selected
candidate family remains `variational_mps_als`, with mean candidate relative
response error `0.01805548365563228` versus seeded pressure
`0.0004416259745141553`. This is useful negative evidence and a runnable
denominator-engine shell, not production DMRG, not a deployable tensor solver,
not a same-access positive route, and not a quantum advantage claim.
The W1 canonical residual blocker gate now decomposes the next production
solver obligations. It checks 8 requirements: 4 pass and 4 fail (`C3` stored
canonical environments, `C4` orthonormal residual ledgers, `C5` all-row
convergence evidence, and `C7` same-access production cost ledger). The gate
records 0 environment rows, 0 residual rows, 0 convergence-passed rows, and 4
PR packets: `W1-E4-env-residuals`, `W1-E5-convergence`,
`W1-E6-seeded-pressure`, and `W1-E7-cost-ledger`. This is a useful handoff
contract for future agents, not production DMRG and not a positive route.
The W1 implementation contract gate now makes that handoff stricter. It
declares the row-level artifact schema for any future production DMRG/MPS PR:
17 required row keys, the locked 9-row contract hash, and four implementation
packets covering environments/residuals, convergence, seeded-pressure
comparison, and same-access production costs. The contract checks 10
requirements: 5 pass and 5 fail (`K5`-`K9`). There are still 0 environment
rows, 0 orthonormal-residual rows, 0 discarded-weight rows, 0 convergence
rows, 0 rows beating seeded pressure, and no complete same-access cost ledger.
This is still not production DMRG, not a same-access positive route, not a
BQP separation, and not a quantum advantage claim.
The W1 prototype environment scout now maps reusable smoke-gate evidence
without promoting it into a production claim. It checks 8 requirements: 5 pass
and 3 fail (`P5`-`P7`). The older two-site smoke gate contributes 9 prototype
environment-ledger rows, 9 prototype trace hashes, and 9 discarded-weight
metrics under the locked B5/B10 row contract. However, accepted canonical
left/right environment hashes, orthonormal residual rows, production
discarded-weight rows, and production contract rows all remain 0. The next W1
solver must turn those prototype traces into accepted 17-key production row
artifacts before any K5/K6 progress, production DMRG claim, or positive
B10-T1 route can be counted.
`T-B5-006l` / `T-B10-014j` now adds a W1 production-row intake template
gate. It consumes the implementation contract and prototype scout, then emits
9 locked row templates under the same row-contract hash. The gate checks 8
requirements: 5 pass and 3 fail (`I5`-`I7`). It carries all 9 prototype trace
hashes as provenance, keeps the 17-key row schema, pre-fills 9 stable keys per
row, and exposes 8 production-required keys that still must be submitted:
canonical center site, left/right environment hashes, orthonormal residual
norm, discarded weight, wall-clock time, peak memory, and sweep/matvec count.
Submitted production rows and accepted production rows remain 0, so this is a
PR intake template, not production DMRG, not a deployable denominator, not a
same-access positive route, not quantum advantage, and not BQP separation.
`T-B5-006m` / `T-B10-014k` now turns that intake surface into an agent-ready
blocker queue. It consumes the 9 templates and the W1 implementation contract,
checks 9 queue requirements, passes 6, and fails only `Q6`-`Q8` because no
production row has been submitted or accepted yet. The gate partitions all 72
missing production fields into three PR-sized packets: `W1-E4-env-residuals`
with 36 missing fields, `W1-E5-convergence` with 9 missing fields, and
`W1-E7-cost-ledger` with 27 missing fields. The queue is useful because it
tells solver, baseline, and cost-ledger agents exactly which row artifacts to
submit first while preserving the locked row-contract hash. It is still not
production DMRG, not a seeded-pressure win, not a same-access positive route,
not quantum advantage, and not BQP separation.
The latest B10-T1 stress test still finds no positive same-access route because
0 rows beat explicit D5 matvec-equivalent costs by shots. This is progress, but
it is not a production DMRG result, not a deployable tensor solver, not a
sampling oracle, and not a quantum advantage claim.

B3/B10 now has a same-access negative boundary note for the chemistry route.
It consumes the failed measurement-rescue gate and records 9/9 satisfied
negative-boundary conditions. The source rescue gate still passes 5/10 and
fails M5-M9: full cross-molecule compiled-state covariance, multi-parameter or
converged chemistry ansatz evidence, selected-CI/FCI denominator wins,
optimizer-loop shots below the positive-route stress ceiling, and B10 access
contract acceptance. Current B3 evidence still has 0 denominator wins, max
optimizer-loop shots lower bound 475,043,013,690,000, max optimizer-loop
two-qubit executions lower bound 281,225,464,104,480,000, and B3 remains
demoted. This is not a reaction dynamics solution, not quantum advantage, and
not a BQP separation.

B4/B8 now has an OpenQASM 3 randomized-measurement packet for the shared
hidden-projection verifier spine. The packet exports 36 hardware-executable
verifier circuits across 3 tasks, 3 refresh modes, and 4 circuit instances per
task-mode; every file starts with `OPENQASM 3.0`, the maximum circuit size is
30 qubits including verifier ancillas, and the Qiskit/Aer semantic mismatch
count is 0. This is a circuit packet and semantic check only, not hardware
execution, sampling hardness, cryptographic soundness, quantum advantage, or a
BQP separation claim.

The follow-up B4/B8 public-packet spoofer gate rejects a public-protocol
soundness interpretation of that packet. A deterministic parser/emulator can
predict all 36 public OpenQASM 3 packet transcripts, giving a public-packet
spoofer acceptance rate of 1.0. This is a guardrail, not a failure of a private
protocol: the next gate must late-bind private challenge material, use real
backend or hardware execution, or attack transcripts that do not embed the
verifier's private material in public QASM.

The next B4/B8 late-bound private-challenge contract gate now separates the
public skeleton from verifier-private masks and challenge flips for all 36
packet circuits, but it also keeps the hard blocker visible: the public data
skeletons are still deterministic X/CX/measure circuits, so the data transcript
is classically predictable. The contract passes 4 of 8 gates and fails 4 of 8;
late-bound private parity challenges alone are not enough for protocol
soundness without non-stabilizer structure, real backend properties, hardware
execution, or otherwise non-public/non-predictable transcripts.

The follow-up non-stabilizer late-bound transcript pilot now adds an H plus
T/RZ(pi/4) challenge-basis layer to all 36 public skeletons. It removes the
deterministic transcript blocker: 36/36 pilot circuits have non-stabilizer
basis gates, the old deterministic emulator no longer predicts a single
transcript, minimum min-entropy is 4 bits, and maximum output probability is
0.0625. This is still an exact small-probability pilot, not hardware execution,
cryptographic soundness, sampling hardness, quantum advantage, or BQP
separation.

The next B4/B8 support-aware spoofer gate keeps that boundary honest. Four
public-support spoofer families attack all 36 pilot circuits. Exact transcript
guessing remains capped at 0.0625, so the single-transcript blocker survives,
but a support-only verifier is fully spoofable with support acceptance 1.0.
That rejects support-membership soundness and forces the next protocol step
toward verifier-private predicates, real backend properties, or hardware
randomized-measurement execution.

B4/B8 now has the first verifier-private predicate pressure gate on top of
that support-spoofer boundary. The gate adds four late-bound private predicate
bits to the same 36 pilot circuits and 4 spoofer families. In the no-leakage
analytic model, public support-only acceptance falls from 1.0 to 0.0625, a
16x guessing burden. The leakage boundary remains explicit: leaking one private
predicate bit raises acceptance to 0.125, and full predicate leakage returns
acceptance to 1.0. This is useful protocol pressure, not hardware execution,
not cryptographic or protocol soundness, not sampling hardness, not quantum
advantage, and not a BQP separation claim.

B6 has moved from a synthetic descriptor toy to curated leakage audits,
structural/electronic proxy boundaries, and a crystallographic reproducibility
gate. The latest gate audits an existing crystallographic descriptor result
with 56 records, 28 families, and 18 negative controls. It passes 6/11 checks
and fails R6-R10: the current runtime lacks `pymatgen`, source validation
errors remain 2, post-split crystallographic AP is 0.2476 versus family-prior
AP 0.4901, and there are still no DFT or B5-computed observables. This is not a
material-discovery, solved-mechanism, DFT-observable, B5-observable, or
solution claim.

`T-B6-005` converts those failed crystallographic-readiness checks into a
reproducible evidence contract. The contract checks 8 requirements: 3 pass and
5 fail. Failed gates `K4`-`K8` map directly to five PR packets: reproducible
crystallographic backend, source-validation cleanup, post-split family-prior
denominator defeat, DFT observable channel, and B5-computed observable channel.
This is still not a material-discovery, mechanism, complete-database, DFT,
B5-observable, or solution claim.

`T-B6-005b` adds a crystallographic packet scout over that contract. The scout
checks 8 requirements: 3 pass and 5 fail (`S4`-`S8`). It maps 5 packets while
preserving the 56-record / 28-family / 18-negative-control scope, 27
post-split records, crystallographic AP 0.247619 versus family-prior AP
0.490136, 2 source-validation errors, no pinned backend, 0 DFT observable rows,
and 0 B5-computed observable rows. The result is a sharper intake map for
materials and B5 agents, not a material-discovery, mechanism, DFT-observable,
B5-observable, reproducible-descriptor, or solution claim.

`T-B6-005c` adds a validation-rescue scout over the same 56-record table. A
predeclared `physics_risk_adjusted_v0` score keeps 2 negative controls in
top-k and reaches post-split AP 1.0 versus family-prior AP 0.490136, so the
source-validation symptoms have a plausible engineering route. The gate still
fails `V6`-`V8` because there is no pinned crystallographic backend, no DFT
observable channel, and no B5-computed observable channel. The source screen is
not rewritten, and no material-discovery, mechanism, DFT/B5-observable, or
solution claim is made.

`T-B6-005d` adds a backend replay scout for that rescue. The repo-local replay
recomputes `physics_risk_adjusted_v0` from the existing table, pins the source
table, formula, and replay hashes, and reproduces post-split AP 1.0 with 2
negative controls in top-k. The gate now passes 6/8 and fails only `R7`-`R8`:
DFT observable rows and B5-computed observable rows remain 0. This is a
deterministic replay artifact, not an external crystallographic backend, source
rewrite, material-discovery, mechanism, DFT/B5-observable, or solution claim.

`T-B6-005e` adds an observable contract gate over the backend replay. It
declares 5 observable packets, an 11-key DFT row schema, an 11-key B5 row
schema, and hash-preservation requirements for the source table, replay formula,
and replay table. The gate passes 4/6 and fails `O5`-`O6` because DFT rows and
B5 rows are still 0. This is a contract for future observable PRs, not
observable evidence or a candidate-ranking promotion.

B2 has moved past the earlier reduced-round artifact into a leakage-flagged
erasure analytic boundary: 480 configurations, 42 proxy target-volume improved
rows, 33 distance-5/7 improved rows, no reduced rounds, and no new-code,
threshold, device, or circuit-level decoder claim.

B2 now also has a Stim HERALDED_ERASE / DEPOLARIZE1 stress boundary, a
false-positive overhead stress, a posterior-calibrated shot-conditioned leakage
boundary, a posterior-weighted decoder-risk ledger, a decoder-input contract
feasibility gate, a per-shot decoder trace packet, a posterior-likelihood
injection gate, a DEM-informed detector-to-edge semantics gate, and a
hardware-like leakage observation model gate, a calibration-transfer guardrail,
a calibrated-evidence contract gate, and now a calibrated trace scout. The
latest B2 scout consumes the contract, guardrail, per-shot trace packet, and
hardware-like leakage profiles. It checks 8 scout requirements: 5 pass and 3
fail (`S5`, `S6`, `S7`). The scout preserves 576 synthetic traces, 3 challenge
trace hashes, 482 synthetic flag events, 9 hardware-like profile results, and
864 holdout profile-shots, but still has 0 calibrated flag observation rows, 0
real hardware trace rows, and 0 strict holdout improvement rows. The best
conservative hardware-like profile remains 16 holdout baseline failures, 16
holdout injected failures, and holdout failure delta 0. Calibration transfer,
production decoder readiness, threshold support, calibrated trace readiness,
hardware support, quantum advantage, and new-code support all remain false.
This is a sharper handoff artifact, not a circuit-level decoder, production
decoder, threshold, hardware result, quantum-advantage result, or new-code
claim.

B9 now has a local parametric certificate checker plus a proof-environment
contract gate, proof-project scaffold, and CI handoff for the
`cluster_stabilizer_open_uniform_reweight` family. The
local checker verifies the n >= 4 formula-level term count, support set {2,3},
max locality 3, exact uniform scale 27/20, finite rows n=4,5,6, and
normalized-gap invariance with a repo-local exact-rational verifier. T-B9-004d
adds `lean-toolchain`, `lakefile.lean`, a `B9.ClusterStabilizer.WidthLocality`
module, and an indexed theorem interface that replaces the old `True`
placeholder. T-B9-004e adds `research/ci/b9-lean-proof-scaffold.yml` as a
Lean/Lake workflow template plus a CI contract gate that checks 8 requirements,
passes 7, and fails only C8 because no active remote CI run artifact or checked
theorem output has been recorded. The active `.github/workflows/` handoff is
left for a token with workflow scope.
Readiness remains 6/9 gates passed, the contract remains 5/8 requirements
passed, and the open packets remain actual Lean 4/Lake execution plus
proof-assistant checked formal output. This is useful because it makes the next
formalization work assignable and auditable, but it is still not a Lean/mathlib
theorem, not a Quantum PCP proof, not an NLTS theorem, and not a global
gap-amplification no-go theorem.

B1/B7 now has a template-priority gate for the current `gcm_h6` bottleneck.
The gate evaluates the 12 retained nonlocal templates from the B7 scan and
finds 0 single-template one-angle routes that clear the one-sided 1.20x
`gcm_h6` target. The best template remains `w8_21`, but it needs at least 2
arbitrary removals per occurrence and still has no exact occurrence-removing
certificate after 43,480 prior optimizer runs. This is not a resource-saving
claim, not a symbolic lower bound, and not a solved B7 result; it narrows the
next useful work to a symbolic KAK/Clifford-scaffold proof, an alternate
certified rewrite, or stronger B1 T-resource reduction.

B1 now also has a `gcm_h6` target selector. It reads the current U3
phase-factored B1 QASM, counts 270 arbitrary decimal rotations, and ranks
families that could meet the B7 target if a future rewrite removes one rotation
per occurrence: 3 local CNOT-cone classes, 2 canonical angle classes, and 4
qubit classes meet the 30-occurrence target. This is a target-selection
artifact only; it is not a rewrite, not a semantic certificate, and not a
resource-saving claim.

B1/B7 now further has a cone-feasibility gate for the same `gcm_h6` bottleneck.
The 3 target cone classes cover 111 occurrences, but strict direct
CNOT-rotation-CNOT sandwiches total only 4. Under a stricter pair-local
single-arbitrary-window filter, only `cone_01` clears the 30-occurrence target,
with 35 candidate windows. This makes `cone_01` the next concrete rewrite
target; it is still not a rewrite, not a semantic certificate, and not a
resource-saving claim.

B1/B7 also has a restricted `cone_01` phase-removal gate. It tests all 35
candidate windows under a narrow same-envelope hypothesis: delete the arbitrary
RY or replace it with a local Z phase while keeping the two surrounding CNOTs.
The result is negative: remove-only, fixed Z-phase replacement, and continuous
RZ replacement each have 0 exact-pass windows at tolerance 1e-8. The best
continuous-RZ residual is 0.36435162331705345. This closes the simple
phase-absorption route, but it is not a global obstruction theorem and not a
B7 resource-saving claim.

B1/B7 now has one more restricted `cone_01` gate: Euler reabsorption. It locks
the arbitrary RY to 9 exact/Clifford-like candidate angles and lets neighboring
target-qubit RZ phases reoptimize inside the same two-CNOT envelope. Across the
same 35 windows, the exact-pass count is still 0; the best residual is
0.21253656711362606 and the median residual is 0.3643516233170531. This closes
another narrow same-envelope route and pushes the next useful work toward
broader two-qubit synthesis or a KAK/Clifford scaffold.

B1/B7 also now has a `cone_01` parameter-transfer obligation gate. It checks
the same 35 candidate windows and finds that all 35 original RY(theta)
occurrences have nonzero unitary sensitivity, 0 are near the pi/4 exact grid,
and the windows collapse into 4 theta groups. This means deletion without a
theta carrier cannot clear the B7 30-window target. Future synthesis must
explicitly carry, share, or eliminate theta with replayable certificates before
any B7 ledger saving can be counted.

B1/B7 now also has a `cone_01` theta-sharing ledger gate. The 4 theta groups
create 31 duplicate theta occurrences and an optimistic cache-reuse signal of
620 proxy-T units, which would clear the 600 proxy-T target only under a cache
model. The current occurrence-based FT ledger does not accept that as a physical
saving: counted occurrence removal is 0, counted proxy-T reduction is 0, and the
B7 target remains uncleared. The next useful `T-B1-004` artifact must therefore
produce at least 30 occurrence-removing certificates or justify a new physical
theta-sharing cost model before B7 can count a resource delta.

The follow-up `cone_01` physical cost-model gate now makes that second route
explicit. A shared-theta synthesis object proposal gate defines 4 machine-readable
objects covering all 35 candidate windows, a replay-verifier gate checks 4/4
objects plus 35/35 occurrences against source QASM and parameter-transfer groups
with 0 mismatches, and a logical layout/routing scaffold assigns anchor qubits
and route packets for all 35 occurrences. A factory-amortization scaffold then
accounts for the 35 per-occurrence synthesis requests collapsing to 4 shared-object
requests, with 31 amortized saved compiles and a gross 620 proxy-T pressure delta.
The next shared-error budget scaffold allocates a 1e-6 aggregate synthesis-error
budget across the 4 shared-theta objects and records 4 correlation groups. The
independent-baseline scaffold then separates cache labels from accepted
occurrence-ledger savings and confirms zero double-counted occurrences and zero
double-counted proxy-T pressure. The cost-model scaffold has moved from 0/8 to
6/8 acceptance gates by passing CM-02 object existence, CM-03 replay, CM-04
logical layout/routing, CM-05 factory amortization, CM-06 shared-error
budgeting, and CM-07 independent accounting baseline. The model is still not
accepted: the refreshed-B7-ledger gate has now been attempted and explicitly
rejects theta sharing under the current evidence because there are no 30
occurrence-removing certificates, no accepted physical device layout, no physical
factory schedule, no device-calibrated physical validation, no accepted proxy-T
reduction, and no `gcm_h6` min-row improvement. The counted B7 ledger reduction
remains 0.

B1/B7 has now returned from the rejected CM-08 cost-model route to a CM-01
structural obligation gate for `cone_01`. A local-equivalence invariant
diagnostic uses a magic-basis, determinant-normalized trace fingerprint over
all 35 candidate windows. The result is useful but still incomplete: 24 windows
show nonzero local-equivalence invariant sensitivity to `RY(theta)`, and those
same 24 mismatch the nearest pi/4-grid invariant; 11 windows remain
invariant-flat under this diagnostic. This blocks a local-only absorption
interpretation for 24 windows, but it does not clear the B7 requirement of 30
certified windows. There is still no KAK theorem, no occurrence-removing
rewrite certificate, no semantic certificate, no accepted physical cost model,
and no B7 resource-saving claim.

B1/B7 has now pushed that `cone_01` carrier route through blocker-stack,
motif, CNOT-parity, interleaving-commutation, and semantic-replay-packet gates.
The cheap routes are rejected: the current blocked source-aligned candidates
have 11 repeated same-edge blocker pairs, 0 clean adjacent CNOT cancellations,
18 interleaving single-qubit operations, 4 target-side phase obstructions, and
7 non-diagonal interleaving obstructions. The latest packet gate is constructive
but still not a solution: it turns the 3 blocked carrier CNOT stacks into exact
bounded two-qubit replay targets with 4x4 matrix fingerprints, covering 32
window gates total, 14 CNOTs, 18 single-qubit gates, and 3 distinct semantic
fingerprints. No shorter replay, occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, B7
ledger improvement, or solved-problem claim is made.

B1/B7 now also has a restricted packet-synthesis search over those exact
targets. It searches fixed-direction 0/1/2/3-CNOT scaffolds with arbitrary local
U3 layers and finds numerical exact reduced-CNOT candidates for all 3 packets:
candidate line 1378 reaches 1 CNOT from source 4, and candidate lines 1381 and
268 reach 2 CNOTs from source 5. The candidate CNOT reduction is 9 if a later
gate accepts the replacements. The current gate does not accept them yet:
full-circuit replay, symbolic/exact decomposition boundaries, local-layer
resource accounting, occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, and B7 ledger
improvement all remain open.

The follow-up replay/resource gate now rejects that route as a B7 ledger
improvement under the current accounting rules. The 3 bounded packet targets
remain numerically replay-consistent, but the reduced-CNOT scaffolds replace 1
source off-pi/4 parameter with 40 replacement off-pi/4 local-U3 parameters,
adding 780 proxy-T pressure. Accepted full-circuit replay certificates,
occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, and B7 ledger improvement remain 0.

The next local-U3 exactification gate now closes the cheapest repair attempt.
It snaps all 40 replacement off-pi/4 local-U3 parameters to the pi/4 grid and
replays the same three packet targets. The snapped packets have 0/3 exact
passes with residuals from 0.4757435265 to 0.7803612881, so cheap grid snapping
breaks the bounded replay instead of producing an accepted exact decomposition.
Accepted local-U3 exactification, absorption certificates, full-circuit replay,
occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, and B7 ledger improvement remain 0.

The sparse local-U3 repair gate then tests the next-cheapest route: keep the
pi/4-snapped scaffold, but free only one or two local-U3 parameters. It searches
420 sparse repair candidates. One bounded packet, line 1378, is repaired by
changing one snapped grid choice; the other two packets remain unrepaired even
with two free parameters. This is partial packet evidence only. It is not a
full-circuit rewrite, not a symbolic decomposition, and not a B7 ledger saving.
Accepted occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, and B7 improvement remain 0.

The three-parameter local-U3 repair continuation now exhaustively searches the
two unresolved packets from that gate. It checks 1,632 exactly-three-parameter
repairs and exactifies line 268, while line 1381 remains unrepaired with best
residual 0.049865177666770955. The portfolio now has 2/3 bounded packet
repairs, with candidate CNOT reduction 6 if those packets were later accepted.
They are not accepted yet: symbolic decomposition, full-circuit replay,
occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, and B7 ledger improvement remain 0.

The four-parameter line-1381 pressure gate then exhaustively searches 3,060
exactly-four-parameter repairs for the last unresolved packet. It improves the
best residual from 0.049865177666770955 to 0.02997767950993884, but still finds
0 exact repairs. The reduced-CNOT packet route therefore remains at 2/3 bounded
packet repairs, and accepted occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, and B7
ledger improvement remain 0. The next route must broaden the scaffold,
formalize a scoped obstruction for line 1381, or move to a different
ledger-reducing construction.

The five-parameter line-1381 exact-repair gate then searches the same
two-CNOT pi/4-snapped scaffold with exactly five freed local-U3 parameters and
finds a first exact packet repair after 5,795 of 8,568 deterministic
combinations. The best residual is 6.513934436930801e-13, so all three reduced
CNOT packets now have bounded packet-level repairs. This is real progress, but
it is still not an accepted B7 saving: the line-1381 repair carries five
off-grid local-U3 parameters, no symbolic full-circuit replay certificate has
been emitted, and accepted occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, and B7 ledger
improvement remain 0.

The repaired-packet resource-boundary gate now consumes the three bounded
packet repairs together. It preserves the 3/3 packet-repair status and the
candidate 9-CNOT reduction signal, while reducing replacement off-grid local-U3
parameters from 40 to 5 and incremental proxy-T pressure from 780 to 80. That
is a meaningful narrowing of the resource blocker, but not a ledger win:
accepted full-circuit replay certificates, occurrence removal, proxy-T
reduction, and B7 improvement all remain 0. The next route must exact-decompose
or absorb the five remaining line-1381 off-grid local-U3 parameters and emit
symbolic full-circuit replay certificates before any B7 saving can be counted.

The line-1381 exact-decomposition pressure gate now tests those five remaining
off-grid local-U3 parameters against the simple acceptance contracts: pi/4
grid, low-denominator power-of-two pi grid, rational-pi grid up to denominator
512, and source-angle absorption. All five parameters remain unaccepted:
pi/4, dyadic-pi, rational-pi, source-absorption, symbolic decomposition,
full-circuit replay, occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, and B7 ledger
improvement all stay at 0. This closes the cheap exact-decomposition route but
does not prove a global obstruction; the next route must use broader symbolic
synthesis, context-aware absorption, or full-circuit replay with honest
resource pricing.

The follow-up line-1381 context-absorption gate checks whether those same five
parameters can be absorbed by exact inventory matches or one-step same-support
context cancellation in the native optimized `gcm_h6` QASM. It reviews 2,049
rotation arguments overall and 44 same-support context rotation arguments
inside the configured +/-64-line neighborhood. The result is still negative:
0/5 parameters have exact or absolute-angle inventory matches, 0/5 have
same-support context matches, 0/5 exactly cancel back to the pi/4 grid, and B7
accepted occurrence/proxy-T reduction remains 0. This closes only a cheap
single-step context route; multi-rotation symbolic absorption and full-circuit
replay remain open.

The next line-1381 multi-rotation context gate broadens that pressure test to
signed sums of two or three same-support context rotations. Across the same 44
context rotation arguments, it evaluates 3,784 width-2 signed combinations and
105,952 width-3 signed combinations per parameter, or 548,680 total signed
combination tests across the five remaining parameters. The result remains
negative: 0/5 parameters have exact width-2 or width-3 absorption back to the
pi/4 grid, the best width-3 grid error is 1.5819911093339911e-3, and accepted
full-circuit replay, occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, and B7 ledger
improvement remain 0. This closes a bounded two-/three-rotation context route;
four-or-more-rotation symbolic absorption, commutation-aware replay, and
different occurrence-removing scaffolds remain open.

The follow-on four-rotation context gate tests the next bounded rung before
leaving the local context path. For each of the same five line-1381 parameters,
it evaluates 2,172,016 signed width-4 combinations from the same 44 context
rotation arguments, or 10,860,080 total signed combination tests. The result is
again negative: 0/5 parameters have exact width-4 absorption back to the pi/4
grid, the best width-4 grid error remains 1.5819911093339911e-3, and accepted
full-circuit replay, occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, and B7 ledger
improvement remain 0. This closes an exactly-four-rotation context route; a
future route must justify five-or-more symbolic absorption, commutation-aware
full-circuit replay, or a different occurrence-removing scaffold.

The next commutation-corridor gate moves from bounded angle arithmetic toward
replay pressure. It reviews the 10 best two-/three-/four-rotation context
candidates from T-B1-004ap/aq, covering 32 context references on 8 unique lines.
The cheap corridor model accepts 0 candidates: 7 references sit inside the
target packet, 13 references are not standalone RZ-like rotations, 21 references
have support-touching CNOT or non-diagonal single-qubit blockers, and 0 external
standalone-Z references have a clear path into line 1381. Accepted full-circuit
replay, occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, and B7 ledger improvement remain
0. This does not prove a global obstruction, but it closes the cheap
commutation-corridor interpretation of the current bounded context hints.

The follow-on full-circuit replay obligation gate turns that boundary into a
reviewable checklist. T-B1-004as confirms that all 3 reduced-CNOT packets still
have bounded exact repairs, but 0/3 have symbolic exactness certificates,
full-circuit replay events, replacement QASM patches, occurrence-class lifts, or
B7 ledger acceptance. Two packets are resource-clean at bounded-packet level;
line 1381 still has one unpriced off-grid local-U3 burden after the failed exact
decomposition, bounded context, and cheap corridor routes. Accepted full-circuit
replay, occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, and B7 ledger improvement remain
0. The next useful PR must create actual replay certificates or a different
occurrence-removing route, not another local diagnostic that cannot enter the
B7 ledger.

T-B1-004at now converts the replacement-QASM obligation into concrete bounded
OpenQASM 3 patch snippets. All 3 repaired reduced-CNOT packets have bounded
QASM3 snippets and all 3 pass the bounded exactness check, preserving the
candidate 9-CNOT reduction if a future full-circuit patch is accepted. The gate
still rejects B7 credit: the line-1378 and line-1381 source windows overlap on
lines 1369-1377, so the snippets are not a composable full-circuit patch set.
Accepted full-circuit patches, replay certificates, occurrence removal,
proxy-T reduction, and B7 ledger improvement remain 0. The next useful PR must
merge or resynthesize the overlapping patch region and then replay it against
the source circuit.

T-B1-004au now prevents double-counting that overlap. It enumerates
non-overlapping bounded patch subsets and selects line 268 plus the larger
line-1381 window, dropping line 1378 because it is contained in the line-1381
source window. The candidate CNOT signal is therefore 6 for the current
composable bounded subset, not the naive 9. No full-circuit QASM rewrite is
emitted yet because the source benchmark is still a legacy OpenQASM 2.0 fixture
while the bounded replacement snippets are OpenQASM 3 snippets. The project
route is OpenQASM 3-facing; no replay certificate, occurrence removal, proxy-T
reduction, or B7 improvement is accepted.

T-B1-004av now bridges that subset into a concrete legacy-dialect replay
candidate at
`results/B1_B7_cone01_qasm2_candidate_rewrite_gate/gcm_h6_line268_line1381_candidate.qasm`.
The candidate rewrites the line-268 and line-1381 windows and down-converts the
bounded OpenQASM 3 `U` snippets only to match the current legacy fixture parser,
lowering structural CNOT count from 795 to 789. This is the first
replay-consumable artifact for the branch and a stepping stone toward an
OpenQASM 3 exporter, but it is still not a full-circuit replay certificate, not
a recovered line-1378 merge, not a priced local-U3 resource result, and not a B7
ledger saving. Accepted full-circuit patch, replay, occurrence removal, proxy-T
reduction, and B7 improvement remain 0.

T-B1-004aw then runs the first full-statevector replay probe on that
legacy-dialect candidate. After removing final measurements, the source and candidate
19-qubit circuits have statevector dimension 524,288, state fidelity
0.9999999999999551, max global-phase-aligned amplitude delta
1.3908205762322243e-13, max probability delta 5.551115123125783e-16, and
measured q[4] marginal delta 5.551115123125783e-16. The probe passes for the
benchmark default input state, but it is still not a symbolic unitary proof for
arbitrary inputs and still does not accept B7 occurrence, proxy-T, or ledger
credit.

T-B1-004ax adds sampled-input replay pressure. It runs the same source and
candidate circuits on 8 deterministic input states: 6 computational-basis
preparations and 2 seeded product states. All 8 pass; min state fidelity is
0.9999999999999547, max global-phase-aligned amplitude delta is
1.392888964263601e-13, and max probability delta is
1.8214596497756474e-15. This is stronger than default-input replay, but it is
still sampled evidence, not symbolic arbitrary-input equivalence, and it still
does not accept B7 occurrence, proxy-T, or ledger credit.

T-B1-004ay adds phase-consistency and superposition replay pressure. It checks
the same source/candidate pair on 4 phase-anchor inputs and 4 superposition
inputs after final measurements are removed. All 8 pass; overlap phase spread
is 1.3722356584366935e-13 radians, min overlap magnitude is
0.9999999999999772, min state fidelity is 0.9999999999999547, and max
probability delta is 1.074140776324839e-14. This reduces the risk that
independent per-input global-phase alignment hides an input-dependent phase
mismatch, but it is still sampled evidence, not symbolic arbitrary-input
equivalence, and accepted B7 occurrence, proxy-T, and ledger credit remain 0.

T-B1-004az fixes one global phase from the zero-input replay and reuses that
same phase across a sampled subspace: 6 computational-basis anchors and 15
coherent pair superpositions. All 21 cases pass; max global-anchor phase delta
is 3.142993331217661e-14 radians, min overlap magnitude is
0.9999999999999772, min state fidelity is 0.9999999999999547, and max
probability delta is 1.074140776324839e-14. This is stronger than
independently aligned sampled replay, but it is still a sampled subspace
check, not symbolic unitary equivalence, and accepted B7 occurrence, proxy-T,
and ledger credit remain 0.

T-B1-004ba turns the six basis anchors from T-B1-004az into a finite
linear-span replay certificate. It builds the source/candidate error operator
restricted to the six-dimensional input span under the same zero-input global
phase anchor. The restricted error spectral norm is
2.7889440543898627e-13, max basis L2 error is 2.534056605707275e-13, and 15
coherent pair witnesses remain passed. This certifies only 6 of 524,288 input
dimensions, so it is not a full Hilbert-space unitary proof; accepted B7
occurrence, proxy-T, and ledger credit remain 0.

T-B1-004bb turns the selected non-overlap line-268 plus line-1381 patch subset
into a tolerance-bounded full-circuit semantic patch certificate for the
legacy-dialect candidate. The two selected windows are non-overlapping, both
local-unitary replacement certificates pass, the emitted legacy-dialect candidate
exists, and the candidate keeps the 795 -> 789 CNOT delta. The certificate accepts 1
full-circuit replay/QASM patch artifact, but B7 resource credit remains 0
because line 1378 is still dropped and line 1381 still has 5 unpriced off-grid
local-U3 parameters.

T-B1-004bc prices that remaining line-1381 local-U3 boundary. The five off-grid
local-U3 parameters correspond to 100 proxy-T pressure units under the project
ledger, while the selected CNOT delta remains 6 and the dropped line-1378 delta
remains 3. This is a quantified blocker, not a win: local-U3 pricing is still
not accepted, line 1378 is not recovered, and B7 occurrence, proxy-T, and
ledger credit remain 0.

T-B1-004bd now closes the naive overlap-additivity interpretation of that
dropped line-1378 delta. The line-1378 source window [1369, 1377] is contained
inside the line-1381 source window [1369, 1379] on the same [4, 8] support, so
the union region has only 5 source CNOTs. Adding the line-1381 3-CNOT delta and
the line-1378 3-CNOT delta would require -1 replacement CNOTs. The full dropped
line-1378 delta is therefore not additively recoverable; a future route must
synthesize a new union-region replacement with replay and honest local-U3
pricing, or find a different occurrence-removing certificate.

T-B1-004be tests that honest union-region route with a scoped low-CNOT search.
For the line-1378/1381 union target [1369, 1379], it searches 0-CNOT and
1-CNOT local-U3 scaffolds, including both 1-CNOT orientations. No exact
low-CNOT scaffold is found: the best 1-CNOT residual is
0.2548908758679516 with max entry error 0.12724247975106365. The existing
2-CNOT line-1381 replacement remains the current exact candidate in this
branch, and no extra delta, occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, or B7 ledger
credit is accepted. This is not a global CNOT lower-bound theorem.

T-B1-004bf now checks that 2-CNOT boundary directly with an all-orientation
sequence census. For the same line-1378/1381 union target [1369, 1379], all
four length-2 CNOT direction sequences pass the numerical exact threshold. The
best exact sequence is `01-10`, with residual 5.812946138498332e-13, max entry
error 3.4095575404049453e-13, and 13 off-pi/4 local-U3 parameters among 18
total parameters. This confirms the current 2-CNOT union-region candidate is
not a fragile single-orientation artifact, but it remains candidate-only: no
full-circuit replay certificate, QASM patch, local-U3 pricing acceptance,
occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, or B7 ledger credit is accepted.

T-B1-004bg then prevents that robustness result from being over-counted. It
compares the T-B1-004bf exact 2-CNOT candidates against the current line-1381
pricing boundary. The current line-1381 branch carries 5 off-pi/4 local-U3
parameters, or 100 proxy-T pressure units, while the best-priced 2-CNOT census
candidate still carries 13 off-pi/4 parameters, or 260 proxy-T pressure units.
The census route is therefore pricing-dominated by the current patch boundary:
selected replacement changes, accepted occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction,
and B7 ledger credit all remain 0.

T-B1-004bm checks the cheap grid-pricing escape hatch for the T-B1-004bf
union-region census candidates. It snaps all local-U3 parameters in each of the
four exact 2-CNOT union candidates back to the pi/4 grid and replays the union
target. Exact pass / fail is 0/4. The best grid-snap residual is
0.36435162331693166 on sequence `10-10`, and the worst is 1.021457442072864 on
sequence `10-01`. This rejects a free grid-priced adoption of the union census
route; occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, local-U3 pricing acceptance, and
B7 ledger credit remain 0.

T-B1-004bn tests the next-cheapest union-census pricing escape hatch. For each
of the four exact 2-CNOT union-region candidates, it snaps all local-U3
parameters to the pi/4 grid, frees exactly one parameter, and re-optimizes that
single degree of freedom. All 72 one-free-parameter trials fail exact replay.
The best residual is 0.25709607640616583 on sequence `10-10` at parameter index
7; the worst best-sequence residual is 0.6857140007440164 on sequence `10-01`.
This blocks a 20-proxy-T one-free-parameter adoption of the union route;
occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, local-U3 pricing acceptance, and B7
ledger credit remain 0.

T-B1-004bo now tests the next pricing rung for the same union-census branch.
It snaps all local-U3 parameters in the four exact 2-CNOT union candidates to
the pi/4 grid, then frees every possible pair of parameters and re-optimizes
that pair. All 612 two-free-parameter trials fail exact replay. The best
residual is 0.1831095797026285 on sequence `10-10` at pair `[5, 7]`; the worst
best-sequence residual is 0.46644639853601 on sequence `10-01`. This blocks a
40-proxy-T two-free-parameter adoption of the union route. The remaining useful
routes are now a different scaffold, symbolic/context absorption, honest
larger local-U3 pricing with full-circuit replay, or a different
occurrence-removing branch; occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, local-U3
pricing acceptance, and B7 ledger credit remain 0.

T-B1-004bp adds a targeted three-free expansion pressure test instead of
restarting a broad cheap-cleanup sweep. For each of the four exact 2-CNOT
union-region candidates, it takes the best failed T-B1-004bo two-parameter pair,
adds one more free local-U3 parameter, and re-optimizes the resulting targeted
triple. All 64 targeted three-free trials fail exact replay. The best residual
is 0.04582709543239648 on sequence `10-10` at triple `[5, 7, 4]`; the worst
best-sequence residual is 0.3812803680403496 on sequence `10-01`. This does
not prove an exhaustive three-free lower bound, but it blocks the most natural
60-proxy-T extension of the failed two-free route. Occurrence removal,
proxy-T reduction, local-U3 pricing acceptance, and B7 ledger credit remain 0.

T-B1-004bh sharpens the remaining line-1381 blocker. It snaps each one of the
five current off-pi/4 local-U3 parameters back to the pi/4 grid, then
re-optimizes the other four parameters on the same two-CNOT scaffold. All 5/5
leave-one-out trials fail the exact replay threshold: the best residual is
0.09892087709180968, which is about 9.89e6 times the 1e-8 exact tolerance. This
does not prove global five-parameter minimality, but it blocks a cheap
single-parameter removal claim. Occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, local-U3
acceptance, and B7 ledger credit remain 0.

T-B1-004bi makes that pressure test stricter. It snaps every pair among the
same five off-pi/4 line-1381 local-U3 parameters back to the pi/4 grid, then
re-optimizes the remaining three parameters on the same two-CNOT scaffold. All
10/10 leave-two-out trials fail the exact replay threshold. The best residual
is 0.13583443746892182 for fixed pair [9, 16], and the worst residual is
0.41204448255804876 for fixed pair [16, 17]. This blocks a cheap two-parameter
free-removal claim, but it still does not prove global five-parameter
minimality. Occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, local-U3 acceptance, and B7
ledger credit remain 0.

T-B1-004bj makes the pressure test stricter again. It snaps every triple among
the same five off-pi/4 line-1381 local-U3 parameters back to the pi/4 grid,
then re-optimizes the remaining two parameters on the same two-CNOT scaffold.
All 10/10 leave-three-out trials fail the exact replay threshold. The best
residual is 0.29673862906454757 for fixed triple [4, 9, 16], and the worst
residual is 0.7449029676343185 for fixed triple [4, 16, 17]. This blocks a
cheap three-parameter free-removal claim, but it still does not prove global
five-parameter minimality. Occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, local-U3
acceptance, and B7 ledger credit remain 0.

T-B1-004bk pushes the same boundary to leave-four-out pressure. It snaps every
quadruple among the same five off-pi/4 line-1381 local-U3 parameters back to
the pi/4 grid, then re-optimizes the remaining one parameter on the same
two-CNOT scaffold. All 5/5 leave-four-out trials fail the exact replay
threshold. The best residual is 0.45761708677312707 for fixed quadruple
[3, 4, 9, 16], and the worst residual is 0.8369082341779268 for fixed
quadruple [4, 9, 16, 17]. This blocks a cheap four-parameter free-removal
claim, but it still does not prove global five-parameter minimality.
Occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, local-U3 acceptance, and B7 ledger
credit remain 0.

T-B1-004bl closes the endpoint version of the same cheap-removal story. It
snaps all five current off-pi/4 line-1381 local-U3 parameters back to the
pi/4 grid with no parameter left to re-optimize. The all-grid endpoint fails
the exact replay threshold: exact pass / fail is 0/1, residual is
0.8415210419190079, about 8.42e7 times the 1e-8 exact tolerance. This blocks
an all-grid snap interpretation, but it still does not prove global
five-parameter minimality. Occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, local-U3
acceptance, and B7 ledger credit remain 0.

## AI Agent Collaboration

Axiom Horizon is designed for many agents working in parallel:

- builder agents implement algorithms and experiments;
- baseline adversary agents try to beat or invalidate claimed progress;
- theory agents write proof targets, lemmas, and counterexamples;
- audit agents wire new artifacts into status checks;
- integration agents connect B-tracks such as B1 -> B7 and B5 -> B10;
- maintainer agents review, merge, and update the roadmap.

Codex is the current coordinating maintainer agent for this repository. In
practice, that means Codex keeps the project structure coherent, enforces claim

T-B1-004bq changes scaffold instead of continuing cheap parameter-cleanup tests.
It allows 3 CNOTs for the same line-1378/1381 union target and searches all 8
CNOT direction sequences with arbitrary local-U3 layers. All 8 sequences reach
local exact replay, but the best exact priced candidate still has 18 off-pi/4
local-U3 parameters, or 360 proxy-T pressure units, on sequence `10-10-01`.
That is worse than both the current line-1381 5-parameter / 100-proxy-T
boundary and the best 2-CNOT census 13-parameter / 260-proxy-T candidate; the
3-CNOT scaffold also fails to structurally dominate the current 2-CNOT
line-1381 replacement. Occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, local-U3 pricing
acceptance, and B7 ledger credit remain 0.

T-B1-004br consumes that best exact 3-CNOT priced candidate and asks whether the
18 off-pi/4 local-U3 parameters can be cheaply absorbed by the native optimized
gcm_h6 rotation inventory or by one same-support context rotation in the
line-1378/1381 union window. The answer is negative under this gate: 0/18
parameters have exact inventory matches, 0/18 have absolute-angle inventory
matches, 0/18 have same-support context matches, and 0/18 exactly cancel back
to the pi/4 grid with one context rotation. The best one-step grid-cancellation
error is 0.000655799901145393, still outside the exact tolerance. The 3-CNOT
route therefore remains pricing-dominated; B7 ledger credit remains 0.

T-B1-004bs then broadens the same 3-CNOT absorption test from one context
rotation to signed sums of two or three same-support context rotations. For the
same sequence `10-10-01`, it checks all 18 off-pi/4 parameters against 44
context rotations, with 3,784 width-2 combinations and 105,952 width-3
combinations per parameter. Across 1,975,248 signed-combination tests, exact
width-2 absorption is 0/18, exact width-3 absorption is 0/18, and the best
width-2/width-3 grid error remains 0.000655799901145393. This closes the
bounded two-/three-rotation context escape hatch for the direct 3-CNOT branch;
accepted occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, and B7 ledger credit remain 0.

T-B1-004bt takes the next bounded step for the same direct 3-CNOT branch by
testing exactly four same-support context rotations. The gate keeps sequence
`10-10-01`, 18 off-pi/4 parameters, and 44 context rotations, then evaluates
2,172,016 width-4 signed combinations per parameter. Across 39,096,288 total
signed-combination tests, exact width-4 absorption is 0/18. The best width-4
grid error remains 0.000655799901145393 and the worst best-parameter error is
0.027779719778975753. This closes the bounded exactly-four-rotation context
escape hatch for the direct 3-CNOT branch; accepted occurrence removal,
proxy-T reduction, and B7 ledger credit remain 0.

T-B1-004bu responds to the dialect boundary directly. It consumes the
legacy-dialect line-268 plus line-1381 candidate and exports an OpenQASM 3.0
artifact at
`results/B1_B7_cone01_openqasm3_candidate_export_gate/gcm_h6_line268_line1381_candidate_openqasm3.qasm`.
The export has a valid `OPENQASM 3.0` header, uses `stdgates.inc`, converts
487 legacy `u3` gates to `U`, converts the final measurement to modern
assignment syntax, and preserves operation counts: 789 `cx`, 601 `rz`, 487
`U`, and 1 measurement. This accepts one OpenQASM 3 export artifact, but it is
not a new replay proof, not a local-U3 pricing certificate, not occurrence
removal, and not B7 ledger credit. The next useful gate must parse or replay
the OpenQASM 3 artifact through a modern toolchain and then connect it to
symbolic equivalence or honest resource pricing.

T-B1-004bv then turns that next gate into an explicit dependency boundary. It
strictly parses the OpenQASM 3 artifact with the project's local parser and
confirms 19 qubits, 1 bit, 1,884 statements, 1,878 operation rows, and the same
operation counts as the export gate: 789 `cx`, 601 `rz`, 487 `U`, and 1
measurement. Local parser errors are 0, so one local OpenQASM 3 parse artifact
is accepted. The installed Qiskit core is present, but `qiskit_qasm3_import` is
not installed, so Qiskit's OpenQASM 3 loader is attempted and rejected with a
`MissingOptionalLibraryError`. Qiskit loader parse artifacts, replay proof,
local-U3 pricing, occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, and B7 ledger credit
all remain 0.

T-B1-004bw adds a structural roundtrip gate before any new replay or resource
claim. It normalizes the legacy OpenQASM 2 candidate and the OpenQASM 3 artifact
into canonical instruction streams and compares them exactly. Both streams have
1,878 instructions, zero mismatches, identical SHA256 stream hashes, and the
same operation counts: 789 `cx`, 601 `rz`, 487 `U`, and 1 measurement. This
accepts one structural roundtrip artifact, but Qiskit-loader artifacts, replay
proof, local-U3 pricing, occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, and B7 ledger
credit remain 0.

T-B1-004bx moves that OpenQASM 3 artifact from structural portability into a
project-local semantic replay check. The gate parses the OpenQASM 3 file with
the project's strict subset parser, constructs a `QuantumCircuit` directly, and
compares the resulting 19-qubit default-input statevector against the optimized
source circuit after final measurement removal. The replay passes with fidelity
0.9999999999999551, infidelity 4.4853010194856324e-14, max aligned amplitude
delta 1.3908205762322243e-13, max probability delta 5.551115123125783e-16, and
measured q[4] marginal delta 5.551115123125783e-16. This accepts one
project-local OpenQASM 3 replay artifact, but it is still not a Qiskit loader
parse, symbolic equivalence, arbitrary-input equivalence, local-U3 pricing,
occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, or B7 ledger credit.

T-B1-004by broadens the same OpenQASM 3 replay branch from the default input to
8 deterministic sampled inputs. The project-local parser replays 6
computational-basis preparations and 2 seeded product states against the
optimized source after final measurement removal. All 8 cases pass with min
state fidelity 0.9999999999999547, max infidelity 4.529709940470639e-14, max
aligned amplitude delta 1.392888964263601e-13, and max probability delta
1.8214596497756474e-15. This accepts one project-local OpenQASM 3 multi-input
replay artifact, but Qiskit-loader replay, symbolic/arbitrary-input
equivalence, local-U3 pricing, occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, and B7
ledger credit remain 0.

T-B1-004bz adds phase-consistent replay pressure to that OpenQASM 3 branch. The
project-local parser replays the candidate over 4 phase-anchor inputs and 4
superposition inputs, then checks overlap-phase spread rather than relying only
on per-input global-phase alignment. All 8 cases pass with overlap phase spread
1.3722356584366935e-13 radians, min overlap magnitude
0.9999999999999772, min state fidelity 0.9999999999999547, max aligned
amplitude delta 1.392888964263601e-13, and max probability delta
1.074140776324839e-14. This accepts one project-local OpenQASM 3
phase-consistent replay artifact, but Qiskit-loader replay,
symbolic/arbitrary-input equivalence, local-U3 pricing, occurrence removal,
proxy-T reduction, and B7 ledger credit remain 0.

T-B1-004ca fixes the zero-input global phase anchor for the OpenQASM 3 branch
and reuses that same anchor across 6 basis-subspace anchors and 15 coherent
pair superpositions. All 21 cases pass with max global-anchor phase delta
3.142993331217661e-14 radians, min overlap magnitude 0.9999999999999772, min
state fidelity 0.9999999999999547, max aligned amplitude delta
1.3928889642636009e-13, and max probability delta 1.074140776324839e-14. This
accepts one project-local OpenQASM 3 global-phase subspace replay artifact, but
Qiskit-loader replay, symbolic/arbitrary-input equivalence, local-U3 pricing,
occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, and B7 ledger credit remain 0.

T-B1-004cb turns the OpenQASM 3 global-phase subspace replay evidence into a
finite linear-span certificate. It consumes T-B1-004ca, rebuilds the
OpenQASM 3 candidate through the project-local parser, fixes the same zero-input
global phase anchor, and computes the restricted error operator over the
six-dimensional span generated by the basis anchors. The certificate passes with
linear-span spectral norm 2.7889440543898627e-13, Frobenius norm
6.134324404657074e-13, max basis L2 error 2.534056605707275e-13,
max basis amplitude delta 1.3928889642636009e-13, max basis probability delta
7.771561172376096e-16, max source/candidate Gram delta
1.9984014443252818e-15, and max cross-Gram delta 4.403624367368429e-14.
This accepts one project-local OpenQASM 3 finite-span certificate, but it still
covers only 6 of 524,288 input dimensions and remains separate from
Qiskit-loader replay, full-space symbolic/local-unitary equivalence,
local-U3 pricing, occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, and B7 ledger credit.

T-B1-004cc lifts the selected line-268 plus line-1381 composable patch
certificate onto the OpenQASM 3 artifact. It consumes the QASM2 composable patch
certificate, the OpenQASM 3 structural roundtrip gate, and the OpenQASM 3
finite-span replay certificate. The canonical QASM2/OpenQASM 3 instruction
stream still matches at 1,878 instructions with zero mismatches and SHA-256
`7cd50bea1f5a3c191c5735c0891d3f70f8c07a9cfca9d6e93724e6d49cb36343`; the
selected patch lines remain `[268, 1381]`, the dropped overlap line remains
`[1378]`, max selected patch residual is `6.513210005207597e-13`, max selected
entry error is `4.525273102184799e-13`, and the OpenQASM 3 finite-span spectral
error remains `2.7889440543898627e-13`. This accepts one project-local
OpenQASM 3 composable patch-lift artifact, but it is still not a Qiskit-loader
parse, full-space symbolic/unitary proof, local-U3 pricing certificate,
occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, or B7 ledger credit.

T-B1-004cd adds a provenance seal for the OpenQASM 3 patch-lift chain. It
hash-seals the QASM2 candidate, OpenQASM 3 candidate, QASM2 composable patch
certificate, OpenQASM 3 structural roundtrip certificate, OpenQASM 3 finite-span
certificate, and OpenQASM 3 patch-lift certificate. Both QASM files have 1,884
raw lines and normalize to the same 1,878-instruction stream with SHA-256
`7cd50bea1f5a3c191c5735c0891d3f70f8c07a9cfca9d6e93724e6d49cb36343`; the
provenance seal digest is
`159c9b1d99a607d463fe712a190b35460603712561a4ea8eb4033bf4de495902`. This
accepts one project-local OpenQASM 3 provenance-seal artifact, but it still does
not claim Qiskit-loader parsing, symbolic equivalence, local-U3 pricing,
occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, or B7 ledger credit.

T-B1-004ce adds a source-map gate for the OpenQASM 3 patch-lift chain. It builds
a one-to-one instruction map between the QASM2 candidate and the OpenQASM 3
candidate over all 1,878 normalized instructions, records the map digest
`92a499ea6d549426095fbb0fc878f7033027991621a6d5ea1c03cd25d82e9e1e`, and
confirms raw-line drift count 0. The selected patch lines remain line 268 and
line 1381, mapped to instruction indices 263 and 1375; the dropped overlap line
1378 maps to instruction index 1372. This accepts one project-local OpenQASM 3
source-map artifact, but it still does not claim Qiskit-loader parsing,
symbolic equivalence, local-U3 pricing, occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction,
or B7 ledger credit.

T-B1-004cf compresses that source-map evidence into a reviewable OpenQASM 3
patch witness packet. The packet has 3 rows for candidate lines 268, 1378, and
1381; 2 rows are selected non-overlap witnesses, 1 row is the dropped-overlap
witness, and the instruction indices are 263, 1372, and 1375. The witness packet
hash is `e0d2e63f3f2c16be685baef3360ff68d5765db549c5e17e655a6e74c6fb82dc8`;
max witness residual is `9.049428032408627e-13`, max entry error is
`6.398911863522162e-13`, selected CNOT delta remains 6, and the lost overlap
delta remains 3. This accepts one project-local review packet only; Qiskit-loader
parsing, symbolic equivalence, local-U3 pricing, occurrence removal, proxy-T
reduction, and B7 ledger credit remain 0.

T-B1-004cg removes the previous OpenQASM 3 loader dependency blocker. After
adding `qiskit-qasm3-import>=0.6`, Qiskit's OpenQASM 3 loader parses the
exported candidate with 19 qubits, 1 classical bit, depth 1483, and operation
counts `cx=789`, `rz=601`, `u=487`, `measure=1`. Default-input replay against
the optimized source passes with fidelity `0.9999999999999551`, max aligned
amplitude delta `1.3908205762322243e-13`, max probability delta
`5.551115123125783e-16`, and measured q[4] marginal delta
`5.551115123125783e-16`. This accepts one Qiskit-loader parse artifact and one
Qiskit-loader replay artifact, but it still does not claim arbitrary-input or
symbolic equivalence, local-U3 pricing, occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction,
or B7 ledger credit.

T-B1-004ch broadens that loader-backed evidence from the default input to the
same deterministic 8-input suite used by the project-local multi-input replay
gate. The Qiskit-loaded OpenQASM 3 candidate passes all 8 cases: 6
computational-basis inputs and 2 seeded product states. Minimum state fidelity
is `0.9999999999999547`, max infidelity is `4.529709940470639e-14`, max
global-phase-aligned amplitude delta is `1.392888964263601e-13`, and max
probability delta is `1.8214596497756474e-15`. This accepts one
Qiskit-loader multi-input replay artifact, but it remains sampled numerical
evidence, not arbitrary-input symbolic equivalence, local-U3 pricing,
occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, or B7 ledger credit.

T-B1-004ci adds Qiskit-loader phase-consistent replay pressure. The
Qiskit-loaded OpenQASM 3 candidate passes 4 phase-anchor inputs and 4
superposition inputs with overlap phase spread `1.3722356584366935e-13`
radians, min overlap magnitude `0.9999999999999772`, min fidelity
`0.9999999999999547`, max aligned amplitude delta
`1.392888964263601e-13`, max probability delta
`1.074140776324839e-14`, and 0 failed cases. This accepts one Qiskit-loader
phase-consistent replay artifact, but it remains sampled evidence, not
symbolic or arbitrary-input equivalence, local-U3 pricing, occurrence removal,
proxy-T reduction, or B7 ledger credit.

T-B1-004cj adds Qiskit-loader global-phase anchored subspace replay pressure.
The Qiskit-loaded OpenQASM 3 candidate fixes the zero-input global phase anchor
and reuses it across 6 basis anchors plus 15 coherent pair superpositions. All
21 cases pass with max global-anchor phase delta `3.142993331217661e-14`
radians, min overlap magnitude `0.9999999999999772`, min fidelity
`0.9999999999999547`, max aligned amplitude delta
`1.3928889642636009e-13`, max probability delta
`1.074140776324839e-14`, and 0 failed cases. This accepts one Qiskit-loader
global-phase subspace replay artifact, but it remains sampled subspace
evidence, not symbolic or arbitrary-input equivalence, local-U3 pricing,
occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, or B7 ledger credit.

T-B1-004ck upgrades that loader branch to a finite linear-span replay
certificate. It consumes the Qiskit-loader global-phase subspace gate and the
project-local OpenQASM 3 linear-span certificate, fixes the same zero-input
global phase anchor, and computes the source/candidate error operator over the
6-dimensional basis-anchor span. The loader-backed certificate passes with
spectral norm `2.7889440543898627e-13`, Frobenius error
`6.134324404657074e-13`, max basis L2 error `2.534056605707275e-13`, max basis
amplitude delta `1.3928889642636009e-13`, max basis probability delta
`7.771561172376096e-16`, max source/candidate Gram delta
`1.9984014443252818e-15`, and max cross-Gram delta
`4.403624367368429e-14`. This accepts one Qiskit-loader finite-span certificate
artifact for 6 of 524,288 input dimensions, but it is still not full-space
symbolic equivalence, arbitrary-input equivalence, local-U3 pricing, occurrence
removal, proxy-T reduction, or B7 ledger credit.

T-B1-004cl lifts the composable patch evidence onto the Qiskit-loader path. It
consumes the project-local OpenQASM 3 composable patch-lift gate, the
Qiskit-loader global-phase gate, and the Qiskit-loader finite-span certificate
for the same exported candidate. The selected patch lines remain 268 and 1381,
the dropped overlap line remains 1378, the normalized instruction stream still
has 0 mismatches across 1,878 instructions, and the loader-backed finite-span
certificate keeps spectral norm `2.7889440543898627e-13`, max basis L2 error
`2.534056605707275e-13`, max probability delta `7.771561172376096e-16`, and
max cross-Gram delta `4.403624367368429e-14`. This accepts one
Qiskit-loader-backed composable patch-lift support artifact, but it is still
not full-space symbolic equivalence, arbitrary-input equivalence, local-U3
pricing, occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, or B7 ledger credit.

T-B1-004cm seals the Qiskit-loader evidence chain for drift detection. It
hashes the exported OpenQASM 3 candidate plus the Qiskit-loader replay,
multi-input, phase-consistent, global-phase, finite-span, and composable
patch-lift support artifacts into seal
`d06c1fdae3ad7cad1971cdcdcea1f890d3931924a7e70affc25fdf89737e09a8`. The seal
keeps Qiskit 2.4.1, `qiskit-qasm3-import` 0.6.0, `openqasm3` 1.0.1, 19 qubits,
depth 1483, operation counts `cx=789`, `rz=601`, `u=487`, `measure=1`, 8
multi-input cases, 8 phase-consistent cases, 21 global-phase cases, 0 failed
cases, and the same selected lines [268, 1381] with dropped overlap line
[1378]. This is a reproducibility gate, not a new equivalence theorem:
full-space symbolic equivalence, local-U3 pricing, occurrence removal, proxy-T
reduction, and B7 ledger credit remain 0.

T-B1-004cn reproduces that Qiskit-loader evidence seal. It independently
recomputes all 7 source artifact hashes, reruns the T-B1-004cm seal generator,
and requires the expected, independent, and reproduced seals to match
`d06c1fdae3ad7cad1971cdcdcea1f890d3931924a7e70affc25fdf89737e09a8`. The JSON
report remains byte-stable with hash
`f7a5f57ced33e3d8c3f8be12fbcd0dba26a5b42206dac8bb0e1ed1723a735ad2`, the
Markdown report remains byte-stable with hash
`7a648d78758b0f6499d7a743993714fef3d47932b9b02ec5de317228c7828dc7`, and the
source-hash mismatch count is 0. This accepts one evidence-seal reproduction
artifact, but it is still a reproducibility gate only: full-space symbolic
equivalence, local-U3 pricing, occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, and B7
ledger credit remain 0.

T-B1-004co adds seeded product-state semantic pressure to the Qiskit-loader
OpenQASM 3 path. It consumes the phase-consistent replay gate and the reproduced
evidence seal, loads the same OpenQASM 3.0 candidate through Qiskit's qasm3
loader, removes final measurements, and replays 16 deterministic product-state
inputs generated from seeds
`[17, 29, 41, 53, 67, 79, 83, 97, 101, 113, 127, 131, 149, 163, 181, 191]`
with an `rx/ry/rz` preparation sequence. All 16 cases pass with min fidelity
`0.9999999999999389`, max infidelity `6.106226635438361e-14`, max aligned
amplitude delta `1.3496991625769186e-14`, max L2 aligned amplitude delta
`2.8917153762798005e-13`, max probability delta `8.020927672047762e-16`, and
0 failed cases. This accepts one seeded product-state replay artifact, but it
does not establish arbitrary-input or symbolic equivalence, local-U3 pricing,
occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, or B7 ledger credit.

T-B1-004cp adds the resource-boundary decision gate that the seeded replay
branch needed. It consumes the seeded product-state replay result, the line-1381
local-U3 pricing gate, the theta-sharing cost-model gate, and the refreshed B7
ledger gate. The gate accepts the seeded replay evidence as semantic pressure,
but records all five current resource blockers as still failed: line 1381 keeps
5 off-grid local-U3 parameters and 100 unpriced proxy-T pressure, line 1378's
overlap delta is still unrecovered, accepted occurrence removal is still 0
against the 30-occurrence target, the theta cost model remains rejected at 6/8
acceptance checks, and the refreshed B7 ledger still rejects theta sharing with
600 proxy-T of missing reduction. This accepts one resource-boundary artifact
and prevents replay evidence from being counted as B7 resource credit; accepted
occurrence removal, accepted proxy-T reduction, resource saving, and B7 ledger
improvement remain 0.

T-B1-004cq returns to the line-1381 resource wall and tests whether the five
remaining off-grid local-U3 parameters can be absorbed by signed sums of exactly
five nearby same-support context rotations. A meet-in-the-middle split covers
34,752,256 virtual width-5 signed combinations per parameter, or 173,761,280
virtual tests across all five parameters, using the same 44 context rotation
arguments in the 1305-1443 line window. The result is still negative: 0/5
parameters have exact width-5 absorption back to the pi/4 grid, with best grid
error range `0.001581991109333103` to `0.026659551749407484`. This closes the
bounded width-5 local context route, but it is not a global obstruction theorem.
No full-circuit replay certificate, occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction,
resource saving, or B7 ledger improvement is accepted.

`T-B1-004cr` / `T-B7-010` adds a cone_01 route-triage decision gate over the
current shortcut stack. It consumes the seeded replay resource-boundary,
width-5 context absorption, commutation-corridor, shared-theta
cost-model/refreshed-ledger, and all-grid line-1381 removal artifacts. The gate
triages 5 shortcut routes and accepts 0 for B7 credit: seeded replay keeps 5
failed resource blockers, width-5 context absorption has 0/5 exact hits, cheap
commutation corridor has 0 accepted candidates, shared-theta cache saving
remains rejected by the cost model and refreshed B7 ledger, and all-grid
parameter removal has 0 exact passes. The next route must be a
commutation-aware full-circuit replay certificate, honest line-1381 local-U3
pricing under a physical synthesis model, line-1378 recovery without overlap
double-counting, or a different occurrence-removing scaffold. No occurrence
removal, proxy-T reduction, resource saving, or B7 ledger improvement is
accepted.

`T-B1-004cs` / `T-B7-011` follows the route-triage decision by testing the
honest line-1381 local-U3 pricing route under a conservative physical synthesis
guardrail. The current selected line-268 plus line-1381 patch keeps 5 off-grid
line-1381 local-U3 parameters. With an aggregate synthesis-error budget of
`1e-8`, the per-parameter budget is `2e-9`, the single-parameter T-count bound
is 97, and the five-parameter physical synthesis T-count bound is 485. The
selected 6-CNOT structural delta only supplies 120 proxy-credit units under the
project ledger, leaving a positive cost-minus-credit gap of 365. Physical
synthesis pricing is therefore not accepted, line 1378 is still unrecovered,
and accepted occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, resource saving, and B7
ledger improvement remain 0.

`T-B1-004ct` seals the current OpenQASM 3/Qiskit-loader claim boundary. It
aggregates the byte-stable evidence-seal reproduction, the 6-dimensional
linear-span replay certificate, the composable patch lift, and the seeded
resource-boundary gate into one citable evidence packet. All 8 seal
requirements pass: selected lines remain `[268, 1381]`, dropped overlap line
`[1378]` remains unrecovered, the Qiskit-loader certified input-subspace
fraction is `1.1444091796875e-05`, 16 seeded product-state cases pass with min
fidelity `0.9999999999999389`, and all 5 resource blockers remain open. This is
useful because it prevents replay evidence from drifting into a resource claim:
accepted occurrence removal, proxy-T reduction, resource saving, and B7 ledger
improvement remain 0.

`T-B1-004ee` / `T-B7-013n` consumes the R28 certificate-triad contract and
treats the emitted template as a placeholder submission. The preflight passes
8/8 requirements by rejecting that placeholder: C1 source-lineage, C8
zero-credit claim boundary, and C9 hash surface pass, but C2-C7 fail because
the strict replay rows, same-unitary replay certificate, 31-row same-access
denominator table, leakage-free optimizer trace, machine replay, and offline
bundle evidence are still missing. Preflight hash
`6129db1af66089749a8e3317bd0d3376d90a42991c16dac290f875fc81839c80`; 12
placeholder fields are rejected; O3 remains open; reroute, B7 credit, STV
credit, and resource-saving claims remain 0/false.

`T-B1-004ef` / `T-B7-013o` is the current B1/B7 O3-F4 gate. It narrows the
first missing evidence bundle, C2 strict replay, into an 8-row source-bound
submission template derived from the R24 challenge packet. The gate passes 8/8
requirements by emitting the row template and rejecting it as a placeholder:
8/8 challenge rows are present, every row has the required field surface, but
72 placeholder cells and 0 numeric replay errors mean C2 is not accepted.

O3 remains open; C2 acceptance, reroute, B7 credit, STV credit, and
resource-saving claims remain 0/false.

`T-B1-004eg` / `T-B7-013p` now hardens that C2 surface against a numeric-only
overclaim. It builds a sentinel fixture with all 8 replay errors numerically
below the `1e-08` tolerance; the largest error is `8e-10`, so the numeric
surface passes. The fixture is still rejected because 32 witness, circuit, and
stdout hash cells are invalid placeholders and no real replay command
provenance is supplied. Fixture hash
`78a33f7e7bcbad0f3f5dce8d172d997eb7cde9a43a2b979abd9d852971544e07`;

C2 remains unaccepted; O3, reroute, B7 credit, STV credit, and resource-saving
claims remain 0/false.

`T-B1-004eh` / `T-B7-013q` now hardens C2 again against hash-shape theater. It
constructs a fixture where the numeric surface still passes, every witness,
circuit, and stdout hash has valid sha256 shape, and the replay command has an
executable command shape. The fixture is rejected anyway because all 8 declared
provenance binding hashes fail to recompute from the row payload. Fixture hash

C2 remains unaccepted; O3, reroute, B7 credit, STV credit, and resource-saving
claims remain 0/false.

`T-B1-004ei` / `T-B7-013r` turns the R32 blocker into a submission contract.
The new C2 provenance-binding contract defines 11 binding fields and 9 required
execution artifact surfaces, emits an 8-row template, and rejects the current
state because no source-backed submission or execution artifact exists yet.

C2 remains unaccepted; O3, reroute, B7 credit, STV credit, and resource-saving
claims remain 0/false.

`T-B1-004ej` / `T-B7-013s` now turns that C2 contract into a runnable
preflight verifier. It consumes the R33 contract/template, recomputes the
template hash, then rejects the current placeholder template before any row can
count. The rejection is explicit: 0/8 rows pass, 88 binding fields remain
placeholders, 72 execution artifact cells remain placeholders, 72 hash cells are
invalid, 8 provenance binding hashes fail to recompute from row payloads, and 8
replay errors are nonnumeric. Preflight hash
`bb3cccb45db7d5de25fb2747529d7860aa8b58a093bdfd7ad8bbd756301b67ac`.
C2 remains unaccepted; O3, reroute, B7 credit, STV credit, and resource-saving
claims remain 0/false.

`T-B1-004ek` / `T-B7-013t` now hardens that verifier against metadata-only
evidence. It constructs a fixture whose C2 rows pass the surface requirements:
valid hash shape, recomputed provenance bindings, numeric replay errors below
`1e-08`, and the zero-credit claim boundary. The fixture is still rejected
because the four materialized execution-file classes per row are absent:
replay stdout, source circuit, candidate circuit, and same-unitary witness.
Surface rows pass/fail `8/0`; materialized rows pass/fail `0/8`; missing
materialized files `32`. Fixture hash
`df2c6cc13381c1762bd200a2f77ec0302c32bd6cbbc270b840c05c2778cf2c3a`;

C2 remains unaccepted; O3, reroute, B7 credit, STV credit, and resource-saving
claims remain 0/false.

B4/B8 now has a formal verifier-private challenge protocol model:
`T-B4-002b` / `T-B8-003f` turns the previous private-predicate pressure gate
into a commit-challenge-response-verify protocol over 36 shared challenge rows.
The analytic protocol passes 8/8 gates with hidden-private acceptance 0.0625,
public support-only acceptance 0.5, one-bit leakage acceptance 0.125, and full
private-material leakage acceptance 1.0. This is still not hardware execution,
cryptographic soundness, protocol soundness, sampling hardness, quantum
advantage, or a BQP separation.

`T-B4-002c` / `T-B8-003g` now pushes that protocol into a conservative
noise-modeled transcript bridge. It evaluates 720 transcript/noise/leakage
cases from 36 protocol rows, 4 noise profiles, and 5 leakage profiles.
Under the backend-like predicate-bit error profile, no-refresh honest
acceptance is 0.747047070414 and fails the 0.8 honest threshold, while
challenge refresh reaches 0.805169120213 and refresh plus rotation reaches
0.866618491942. No-leak adversary acceptance remains 0.0625, three-private-bit
leakage rises to 0.5, and full private-material leakage restores acceptance to
1.0. This is a transcript-noise pressure gate only; it still does not use real
backend properties, execute hardware, prove protocol soundness, prove sampling
hardness, claim quantum advantage, or separate BQP.

`T-B4-002d` / `T-B8-003h` adds a deterministic parametric learned/generative
spoofer-pressure diagnostic on top of that noise bridge. It covers 4 spoofer
families across 2,880 pressure rows. The result is intentionally negative:
the artifact is valid with 0 validation errors, but only 6/8 pressure gates
pass. Max no-leak spoofer acceptance reaches 0.1196875 and max backend-like
refreshed no-leak spoofer acceptance reaches 0.109140625, both above the 0.10
diagnostic pressure threshold. Three-private-bit leakage reaches 0.6575 and
full private-material leakage reaches 1.0. This is not actual ML training, real
backend evidence, hardware execution, protocol soundness, sampling hardness,
quantum advantage, or BQP separation.

`T-B4-002e` / `T-B8-003i` replaces that parametric-only warning with an actual
deterministic train/holdout fitted-spoofer diagnostic over the synthetic
transcript bridge. It trains on 560 transcript rows, holds out 160 rows by
protocol index, and evaluates 4 fitted model families across 640 model-row
checks. The private-safe no-leak calibrator stays at 0.0625, including
backend-like refreshed no-leak rows, while leakage-blind mixture fitting reaches
0.35 on no-leak holdout rows and full private-material leakage remains 1.0.
This means the immediate synthetic-transcript break is leakage contamination,
not private-safe no-leak fitting. It is still not real backend evidence,
hardware execution, protocol soundness, sampling hardness, quantum advantage,
or BQP separation.

`T-B4-002f` / `T-B8-003j` adds a real-backend transcript readiness guardrail.
It consumes the fitted-spoofer holdout result plus the B10-T2
GenericBackendV2-style calibrated Aer verifier bridge. The guardrail checks 10
requirements: 5 pass and 5 fail. The missing gates are real backend properties
(`R5`), hardware execution (`R6`), leakage-separated real-transcript fitting
(`R7`), leakage-blind no-leak acceptance below 0.10 (`R8`), and full
private-material leakage bounded below 0.25 (`R9`). The current evidence still
has 0 real backend transcript rows, private-safe no-leak fitted acceptance
0.0625, leakage-blind no-leak fitted acceptance 0.35, and full-private-material
leak fitted acceptance 1.0. This is not real-backend transcript readiness,
protocol soundness, cryptographic soundness, sampling hardness, quantum
advantage, or BQP separation.

`T-B4-002g` / `T-B8-003k` converts the failed readiness guardrail into a
real-backend transcript evidence contract. The contract checks 10 requirements:
5 pass and 5 fail. It preserves the same failed source gates (`R5`-`R9`) and
emits five PR packets: real backend properties, hardware execution,
leakage-separated real fitting, leakage-blind no-leak margin, and full-leakage
containment. The current state still has 0 real backend transcript rows,
leakage-blind no-leak fitted acceptance 0.35, full-private-material leakage
acceptance 1.0, and no protocol-soundness, hardware, advantage, or BQP claim.

`T-B4-002h` / `T-B8-003l` now adds a real-backend packet scout. The scout
consumes the contract, readiness guardrail, and fitted-spoofer holdout
evidence. It checks 9 scout requirements: 4 pass and 5 fail (`S5`-`S9`). It
maps all 5 real-backend PR packets, preserves 5760 backend-calibrated Aer
circuits, 640 fitted evaluation rows, and 160 holdout rows, but still records
0 real backend transcript rows, no real backend properties, no hardware
execution, and no leakage-separated real training. This is a sharper evidence
intake surface, not real-backend readiness, protocol soundness, sampling
hardness, quantum advantage, or BQP separation.

`T-B4-002i` / `T-B8-003m` now quantifies the real-backend soundness margin that
the next transcript PR must beat. It consumes the packet scout and checks 8
margin requirements: 5 pass and 3 fail (`M4`-`M6`). On the current 160-row
synthetic holdout, the private-safe no-leak fitted channel is 10/160 and passes
the <=16/160 no-leak budget. The leakage-blind no-leak channel is 56/160, so a
future real-row claim must remove at least 40 accepted cases or redesign the
split. Full private-material leakage is 160/160, so it must be explicitly
excluded or reduced to <=40/160. Real backend transcript rows remain 0, so this
is a margin ledger for the next PR, not protocol soundness, hardware evidence,
quantum advantage, or BQP separation.

# Axiom Horizon

**An AI Multi-Agent Research Program for Quantum Computing's Hardest Frontiers**

Broader open-source mission: challenge the world's hardest 100 problems through
AI multi-agent research, with a 2-3 year concentrated push on the Top 10
technical frontier tracks.

## Mission

Axiom Horizon is an open-source, AI multi-agent research program built to
challenge the world's hardest long-horizon scientific and technical problems.

The project starts from a living, open map of **100 hard problems**. Outside
users, researchers, and AI agents may propose better problem descriptions,
extensions, parallel tracks, and independent solution programs at any time. The
core Axiom Horizon maintainer effort currently concentrates on the **Top 10
active frontiers**, B1-B10, and turns those tracks into reproducible benchmarks,
algorithms, baselines, negative results, proof attempts, and audit reports.

Our 2-3 year target is not hype. It is a disciplined research goal:

> Build a global, open, AI-assisted research machine that can make credible,
> auditable progress toward solving at least part of the Top 10 frontier
> problems.

We do not claim that any world problem is solved today. We claim that the
project has a structure for making progress that can be reproduced, attacked,
improved, and merged by researchers and AI agents around the world.

## What Makes This Different

Axiom Horizon is not a normal notes repository. It is a research operating
system:

- **Open 100-problem universe**: contributors may open issues or PRs to improve,
  extend, challenge, or launch parallel work on any problem in the catalog.
- **Top 10 attack program**: the current core maintainer focus is B1-B10
  technical resolution. Other problem tracks are intentionally open for outside
  users, researchers, and AI agents to develop through issues and PRs.
- **Multi-agent workflow**: human researchers and AI agents can claim tasks,
  open PRs, and submit reproducible artifacts.
- **Claim boundaries**: every result must say what it does and does not prove.
- **Audit-first culture**: important claims must pass
  `tools/research_portfolio_audit.py`.
- **Translation after evidence**: papers, patents, fundraising, and tools come
  after technical gates, not before.

## Top 10 Active Research Tracks

| Track | Frontier | Current aim |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | Quantum compilation and circuit compression | Reduce routed work and non-Clifford/T-resource proxies with replayable certificates. |
| B2 | Low-overhead quantum error correction | Beat surface-code target volume under honest, same-condition baselines. |
| B3 | Molecular reaction dynamics | Test quantum observable estimation against strong selected-CI/FCI denominators. |
| B4 | Verifiable quantum advantage | Build circuit-level tasks with explicit completeness and soundness pressure. |
| B5 | Strongly correlated quantum matter | Compare embedding, tensor, MPS/DMRG, and quantum response kernels on hard observables. |
| B6 | High-temperature superconductivity | Build leakage-controlled candidate ranking using physics descriptors. |
| B7 | Fault-tolerant quantum computing at scale | Propagate B1/B2 gains through factories, layout, and full resource ledgers. |
| B8 | Classical verification of quantum outputs | Stress challenge-refresh verifiers against leakage and generative spoofers. |
| B9 | Quantum PCP / local Hamiltonian hardness | Produce restricted theorem targets, checked skeletons, and useful negative lemmas. |
| B10 | Boundary of BQP | Separate robust quantum advantage from data-loading, oracle, and verification assumptions. |

## Current Status

The project is active and unfinished.

Current evidence includes:

- an open 100-problem catalog with discipline and source-lineage metadata;
- B1-B10 execution boards and detailed dossiers;
- reproducible scripts under `tools/`;
- machine-readable results under `results/`;
- human-readable research notes under `research/`;
- an audit report in `research/portfolio_status_report.md`;
- a current status page in `research/current_stage_brief.html`.

The current B5/B10 line has recently moved from small-cluster denominators to
seeded MPS pressure, non-seeded one-site MPS/ALS pressure, and a two-site
finite-DMRG-style pressure prototype. The latest B5 gate turns this into a
canonical-DMRG readiness audit: 8 readiness conditions evaluated, 0 passed, 8
failed, 0 non-seeded tensor rows beating seeded MPS pressure, and no production
DMRG, same-access positive route, quantum response win, or accuracy-per-resource
win claimed. The latest B10-T1 stress test still finds no positive same-access
route because 0 rows beat explicit D5 matvec-equivalent costs by shots. This is
progress, but it is not a production DMRG result, not a deployable tensor
solver, not a sampling oracle, and not a quantum advantage claim.

B6 has moved from a synthetic descriptor toy to curated leakage audits and a
structural/electronic proxy boundary. The latest B6 screen keeps 38 records
across 22 families with 12 expanded negative controls; structural/electronic
AP@12 improves to 0.611 versus formula AP@12 of 0.10, but family-prior AP@12
remains 1.0 and the top 12 still include 3 negative controls. This is not a
material-discovery or solved-mechanism claim; the next gate is real
crystallographic, DFT, or B5-computed observables.

B2 has moved past the earlier reduced-round artifact into a leakage-flagged
erasure analytic boundary: 480 configurations, 42 proxy target-volume improved
rows, 33 distance-5/7 improved rows, no reduced rounds, and no new-code,
threshold, device, or circuit-level decoder claim.

B2 now also has a Stim HERALDED_ERASE / DEPOLARIZE1 stress boundary, a
false-positive overhead stress, a posterior-calibrated shot-conditioned leakage
boundary, and a posterior-weighted decoder-risk ledger. The latest B2 ledger
evaluates 4 risk budgets across 4,608 budget/profile rows. The raw T-B2-006
profile survivors are 6; mild/nominal/conservative/strict adjusted survivors
are 6/5/3/3, strict high-purity survivors remain 0, and all-profile robustness
is still false. This is still not a circuit-level decoder, production decoder,
threshold, hardware result, or new-code claim.

## How To Contribute

1. Read `RESEARCH_FRAMEWORK.md`.
2. Pick a task from `research/ops/agent_task_board.md`.
3. Create a branch:

```text
agent/<agent-id>/<B-id>/<short-task>
```

4. Add artifacts:

- benchmark or manifest changes in `benchmarks/`;
- executable method or verifier in `tools/`;
- machine-readable output in `results/`;
- human-readable explanation in `research/`;
- audit integration in `tools/research_portfolio_audit.py` when the result
  becomes part of project state.

5. Run the audit:

```bash
python3 tools/research_portfolio_audit.py \
  --json-output research/portfolio_status_report.json \
  --markdown-output research/portfolio_status_report.md \
  --pretty
```

6. Open a PR using `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

## AI Agent Collaboration

Axiom Horizon is designed for many agents working in parallel:

- builder agents implement algorithms and experiments;
- baseline adversary agents try to beat or invalidate claimed progress;
- theory agents write proof targets, lemmas, and counterexamples;
- audit agents wire new artifacts into status checks;
- integration agents connect B-tracks such as B1 -> B7 and B5 -> B10;
- maintainer agents review, merge, and update the roadmap.

Codex is the current coordinating maintainer agent for this repository. In
practice, that means Codex keeps the project structure coherent, enforces claim
boundaries, routes tasks into PR-sized units, and keeps the audit trail from
drifting away from the actual evidence.

## Bounties And Funding

If the project raises funding, we intend to create public bounty tasks for
high-value PRs: stronger baselines, proof formalization, DMRG/tensor references,
hardware verifier runs, real-data benchmarks, and independent reproductions.

Use the bounty template in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bounty_task.md` when
proposing paid work.

## Claim Policy

Every PR must include a claim boundary:

- what is now supported;
- what is still not supported;
- what stronger baseline or proof pressure could kill the result;
- whether the result is a positive result, negative result, or diagnostic.

Forbidden without evidence:

- claiming a Top 10 problem is solved;
- claiming quantum advantage without a strong denominator;
- claiming hardware relevance without device-like assumptions;
- claiming patentability, fundability, or product readiness before a technical
  gate passes.
